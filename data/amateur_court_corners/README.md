# Amateur-video court corner ground truth

Additional annotations from 8 September 2026 are in [2026-09-08/](2026-09-08/README.md):
nine frames across three further gameplay clips, with supporting landmarks and
an overlay for every frame. The original Curtis Martin dataset below is unchanged.

Hand-annotated court corners for four amateur badminton videos, for scoring
court detection on footage that has no recorded homography. Annotated by
Curtis Martin on 12 Jul 2026 using the manual tool, now at
`scripts/court_annotation/annotate_court_corners_offframe.py`.

| video | frames annotated | notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [C6NrJyBwn6c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6NrJyBwn6c) | 4 | static camera; br, bl off-frame |
| [C1jR4vZmrkI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1jR4vZmrkI) | 3 | camera MOVES between frames; corners are per-frame only |
| [zYqgJo1L5uM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYqgJo1L5uM) | 2 | static camera; br, bl off-frame |
| [BkjErIAsZu4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkjErIAsZu4) | 2 | static camera; bl off-frame, tl and tr occluded (extrapolated positions land inside the image) |

`hand_corners.csv`: one row per corner, four per frame. Columns are in the
tool's docstring; key ones: `corner_label` (tl tr br bl), `visible` (0 means
not clickable) and `source` (extrapolated corners come from a homography
fitted to that frame's clicked landmarks). Extrapolated coordinates sit
outside the image where the corner really is off-frame.

`hand_corners_landmarks.csv`: the clicked crossings each fit used, with court
coordinates in metres. Refitting from these reproduces the extrapolated
corners exactly.

Quality at annotation time: fit rms 2.1 to 3.6 px over 18 to 25 landmarks per
frame; on the static-camera videos, independent per-frame fits agree within
2 to 4 px on every corner. No video shows the whole court, so every frame has
1 to 3 extrapolated corners.

`renders/` holds one visual audit per video: every painted line projected
through the frame's fit, drawn over the actual frame. Regenerate any frame
with `scripts/court_annotation/render_ground_truth.py`.
