"""rtmlib pose-extraction adapter.

Drives rtmlib's low-level RTMDet (person detector) + RTMPose (COCO-17 estimator)
over onnxruntime to reproduce the per-person output the mmpose extraction path
consumed (``keypoints`` / ``bbox`` / ``bbox_score`` / ``keypoint_scores``)
without the mmcv / mmdet / mmpose / mmengine stack or its ``numpy < 2`` pin. It
replaces ``MMPoseInferencer("human")`` for ``raw_extract`` and
``detect_players_2d``. The dataset builder and the court detector's live people
inputs use the same extractor.

The default detector is the ONNX export of the same RTMDet-M person checkpoint
(235e8209) that ``MMPoseInferencer("human")`` resolves at mmpose 1.3.2, run at
its native 640x640. The pose model is ``rtmpose-l body7`` COCO-17, a deliberate
step up from the alias's RTMPose-M body7 (see
docs/architecture_notes/rtmlib_migration/README.md).

Two rtmlib quirks are corrected here:

* ``RTMDet.postprocess`` computes the per-box detection score then returns only
  the boxes; ``RTMDetScored`` recovers the score column (``raw_extract`` and the
  ``sticky_anchor`` heuristic both need ``bbox_score``).
* ``RTMPose`` normalises with an RGB-order mean but never converts BGR->RGB
  (an undocumented rtmlib bug). We feed it an RGB crop so the colour order
  matches the trained model; the detector keeps its native BGR input.

The N_max cap, NaN padding and dtype are the *caller's* concern (``raw_extract``
pads to N_max as float32; ``detect_players_2d`` casts to float64 to match the old
``np.array(list)`` path). This module returns only the real detections.

Consumers import this module lazily (inside their functions) so they stay
importable without rtmlib or onnxruntime installed.
