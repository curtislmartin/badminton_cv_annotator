# Data Pipeline to Model Training: Module Reference

End-to-end walkthrough of the modules needed to go from raw ShuttleSet data to a trained BST-X model, with notes on where a custom (non-BST-X) architecture would diverge.

New here? [`data_pipeline_and_model_train_overview.md`](data_pipeline_and_model_train_overview.md) is the 5-minute narrative; this doc is the module-by-module detail. For the `pipeline/` folder on its own, see [`pipeline/README.md`](pipeline/README.md).

## Quick Start: End-to-End Execution

The project uses three separate Python environments so the pipeline, pose-extraction and training stacks stay independently pinned. All three target **Python 3.11+** (the extraction set is validated on 3.13). The legacy OpenMMLab stack and its numpy < 2.0 pin (`preparing_data/requirements-legacy-3d.txt`, separate venv) remain only as the env for the parked 3D pose stream design.

| Environment | Requirements file | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Pipeline** | `src/bst_x/pipeline/requirements.txt` | Download videos, generate clips, verify output |
| **Pose extraction (rtmlib)** | `src/bst_x/preparing_data/requirements.txt` | Pose estimation (step 1 of data preparation) |
| **BST training** | `src/bst_x/requirements.txt` | Collation, training, inference. Also shared by TrackNetV3. |

### Environment setup

```bash
# Run this setup and the execution commands below from the repository root.
export PYTHONPATH=src:src/bst_x

# 1. Pipeline venv
python3.11 -m venv venv-pipeline
source venv-pipeline/bin/activate
pip install -r src/bst_x/pipeline/requirements.txt

# 2. Pose-extraction venv (rtmlib over onnxruntime; no source builds)
python3.11 -m venv venv-rtmlib
source venv-rtmlib/bin/activate
pip install -r src/bst_x/preparing_data/requirements.txt
# GPU extract box: swap onnxruntime -> onnxruntime-gpu per the notes in that file.
# GPU runtime: onnxruntime-gpu SILENTLY falls back to CPU (~10x slower, two red
# log lines, then it keeps going) unless the dynamic loader can find cuDNN 9 and
# the CUDA 13 runtime libs. The venv bundles both; export BEFORE python starts
# (the loader reads LD_LIBRARY_PATH once, at process start, so the repo .env
# cannot deliver this):
#   SP=$VIRTUAL_ENV/lib/python3.11/site-packages/nvidia
#   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$SP/cudnn/lib:$SP/cu13/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
# Confirmed on bourbaki 2026-07-08 (the pilot pose pass first ran CPU-silent).
# torch (any modern CPU build is fine) is needed only for the prepare_train module path:
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

# 3. BST training venv
python3.11 -m venv venv-bst-x
source venv-bst-x/bin/activate
pip install torch==2.3.1 torchvision==0.18.1 torchaudio==2.3.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
pip install -r src/bst_x/requirements.txt
```

### Execution order

```bash
# ── Stage 1: Build dataset (pipeline venv) ──────────────────────────
source venv-pipeline/bin/activate

python -m pipeline.build_dataset --dry-run                # preview
python -m pipeline.build_dataset --skip-shuttle            # download + clips + verify
# Optional: shuttle extraction (uses BST venv for TrackNetV3)
python -m pipeline.build_dataset --skip-download \
    --tracknet-python /path/to/venv-bst-x/bin/python
# Resume after crash (skip completed steps 3-5, run only shuttle extraction)
python -m pipeline.build_dataset \
    --skip-download --skip-resolution --skip-clips --skip-verify \
    --tracknet-python /path/to/venv-bst-x/bin/python

# ── Stage 2: Pose estimation (rtmlib venv) ──────────────────────────
source venv-rtmlib/bin/activate

# On engelbart, symlink the taxonomy output dir to scratch first (see Stage 2 Setup below).

python -m preparing_data.prepare_train_on_shuttleset \
    --skip-collate                                         # pose only (no shuttle CSV needed)

# ── Stage 3: Collation + training (BST venv) ────────────────────────
source venv-bst-x/bin/activate

python -m preparing_data.prepare_train_on_shuttleset \
    --skip-pose                                            # collate (reads shuttle npys)

python -m bst_x_train                     # train (5 serial trials)
python -m bst_x_infer                     # inference
```

The same `PYTHONPATH=src:src/bst_x` roots are inserted by `conftest.py`, so test and production imports use one layout. Bare-cd invocation from inside the script directory is unsupported.

Each stage's output feeds the next. Stages are independently re-runnable — use `--skip-*` flags to avoid repeating completed work. **Important:** after class merge (step 4) has run, always pass `--skip-clips` on re-runs to avoid re-generating clips that were moved into merged folders.

## Part 1: BST-X on ShuttleSet

### Stage 1 -- Build the Dataset (`pipeline/`)

The pipeline downloads match videos, cuts them into labeled stroke clips, optionally extracts shuttle trajectories, and verifies the result. BST-X paths and splits live in `config.py`; classifier taxonomies live in `classifier_shared/taxonomy.py`. The orchestrator `build_dataset.py` runs the steps in sequence.

#### Modules

| Module | Role | Key functions / concepts |
|--------|------|--------------------------|
| `config.py` | BST-X paths, split membership, and pipeline constants. | `SPLITS`, `EXCLUDED_VIDEOS`, `REMOVED_SHOTS`, and `NOSIDE_FOLDERS`. |
| `classifier_shared/taxonomy.py` | Classifier taxonomy definitions, stroke mappings, and label derivation. | `Taxonomy`, `TAXONOMIES`, `taxonomy_lookup()`, `derive_class_index()`, `UNE_MERGE_V1_MAP`, `MERGE_MAP_25`, and the English/Chinese stroke mappings. |
| `classifier_shared/dataset.py` | ShuttleSet paths, flaw parsing, split metadata, and clip bounds. | `ANNOTATIONS_DIR`, `FLAW_RECORDS_PATH`, `SPLITS_V2_PATH`, `parse_flaw_records()`, and `compute_clip_bounds()`. |
| `build_dataset.py` | One-command orchestrator. Runs steps 1-6 in order with CLI flags to skip individual steps (`--skip-download`, `--skip-resolution`, `--skip-clips`, `--skip-verify`, `--skip-shuttle`). `--skip-clips` skips both clip generation (step 3) and class merge (step 4) since they are tightly coupled: the merge moves clips out of their original folders, so re-running step 3 after a merge would re-generate them from video. | `run_pipeline()` (main entry point), `dry_run()` (preview without side effects), `_validate_inputs()` (fail-fast checks before long work). |
| `download_adapter.py` | Maps ShuttleSet match rows into the scraper-owned yt-dlp downloader. | `download_shuttleset_videos(max_workers)`. New output: `data/shuttleset/raw_video/{id}.mp4`; existing `{id} {match_name}.mp4` files remain readable. |
| `video_metadata.py` | Builds the resolution CSV by scanning each video with OpenCV. | `build_resolution_csv()`. Output: `data/shuttleset/my_raw_video_resolution.csv`. |
| `clip_generator.py` | Extracts individual stroke clips from full match videos. Reads ShuttleSet CSV annotations (Chinese column names), maps A/B players to Top/Bottom, filters excluded videos and removed shots, and organizes clips into `{split}/{Player}_{stroke_type}/` folders. | `generate_all_clips()`, `apply_class_merge()` (moves clips from rare subtype folders into their parent type folders per the active taxonomy's merge map). Three clip window modes: `middle_in_a_sec`, `between_2_hits`, `between_2_hits_with_max_limits` (default, clamps to 1.5s each side). |
| `classifier_shared/player_mapping.py` | Maps ShuttleSet A/B labels to Top/Bottom court positions. Handles set-3 court switches. | `collect_shots()`, `map_players()`, `find_set3_switch_rally()`. |
| `verify.py` | Post-generation sanity checks: all splits present, no clips from excluded videos, no removed shots, merged subtype folders empty, no orphan files. | `verify_splits_present()`, `verify_no_excluded()`, `verify_no_removed_shots()`, `verify_class_merge()`, `verify_shuttle_sync()`, `print_dataset_summary()`. |
| `shuttle_extractor.py` | Runs TrackNetV3 on each clip to detect shuttle positions, then converts CSVs to normalized `(t, 3)` numpy arrays `[x_norm, y_norm, visibility]`. The CSV->npy conversion regenerates every npy unconditionally (no skip-existing), so a re-extract pops a fresh npy rather than leaving a stale one. Uses **batch mode** (`batch_predict.py`) to load models once per worker and iterate over clips in-process, avoiding the ~8s model-reload per clip. Uses the default `eval_mode='weight'` (full temporal ensemble) for maximum detection accuracy. `--batch_size` (default 32, configurable via CLI) controls GPU utilization. Inference runs in **FP32** to preserve detection accuracy on fast-moving shuttles (FP16 rounding can flip the 0.5 heatmap threshold on faint responses). Frames are pre-resized during loading using PIL BICUBIC (bit-identical to the Dataset's own resize). VideoCapture handles are explicitly released and `gc.collect()` + `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` run between clips to prevent resource exhaustion. `--workers N` launches N parallel batch workers, each with its own model copy (use 1 on V100 16GB, 2+ on larger GPUs). On V100 16GB, batch_size 16 fits most clips; a few may OOM, so re-run with batch_size 8 to pick up stragglers (resume logic skips clips that already have CSVs). `--dry-run` processes clips without writing output files (for testing). TrackNetV3 shares the BST training venv. **Pretrained weights** (`ckpts/TrackNet_best.pt`, `ckpts/InpaintNet_best.pt`) must be downloaded separately (~150 MB, gitignored) — see `src/shared/tracknetv3/README.md`. | `extract_all_shuttles(tracknet_dir, tracknet_python, max_workers, batch_size, dry_run)`, `shuttle_csvs_to_npy()`. Intermediate output: `data/shuttleset/shuttle_csv/` (flat dir of per-clip CSVs, taxonomy/split independent). Final output: `data/shuttleset/shuttle_npy/{clip}.npy` (flat; split + label come from `notebooks/clips_master.csv` at collation time). |
| `shared/court.py` | Homography-based camera-to-court projection shared with BRIC and the annotator. | `build_all_court_info()`, `to_court_coordinate()`, `normalize_position()`. |

#### Pipeline output structure

```
data/shuttleset/
  raw_video/                         # Full match videos
  my_raw_video_resolution.csv        # Width/height per video
  clips/                             # Labeled stroke clips (still nested)
    train/{Top,Bottom}_{type}/*.mp4
    val/{Top,Bottom}_{type}/*.mp4
    test/{Top,Bottom}_{type}/*.mp4
  shuttle_csv/                       # TrackNetV3 intermediate CSVs (flat)
    {vid}_{set}_{rally}_{ball_round}_ball.csv
  shuttle_npy/                       # Shuttle trajectories (flat, optional)
    {vid}_{set}_{rally}_{ball_round}.npy
```

Split and label assignment for `shuttle_npy/` (and downstream pose npys) come from `notebooks/clips_master.csv` at collation time, not from directory structure. The clips directory stays nested for now. See `docs/archive/completed_general_refactors/dir_flatten_refactor.md` for the migration.

#### Key concepts

- **Class merging**: Each taxonomy pins its full ordered class list and a merge map that folds rare raw subtypes into parents. The current Architecture 1 active config is `une_v1_14` (4 subtypes folded -> 14 merged types, no sides, unknown excluded); `une_v1_15` is the same plus `unknown` (15). The BST-paper family folds 6 subtypes to 12 base types: `bst_25` (12 x Top/Bottom + `unknown` = 25), `bst_24` (no unknown = 24), `bst_12` (nosides = 12). `shuttleset_18` keeps the 18 raw types (no merge, no sides, no unknown). Whether `unknown` is kept is contractual per taxonomy (its `excluded_base_stroke_types`), not a runtime flag.
- **Flaw records**: `flaw_shot_records.csv` is the single source of truth for data exclusions. Whole-video exclusions and individual shot removals are parsed at import time.
- **Clip windows**: Control how much temporal context surrounds each stroke. `between_2_hits_with_max_limits` (default) uses the interval between adjacent shots, clamped to 1.5s per side.
- **Homography resolution**: The pre-computed homography matrices in `data/shuttleset/set/homography.csv` were calculated at 1280x720 (W x H). `shared.court.scale_pos_by_resolution()` rescales native video coordinates before applying a homography.
- **Video resolution**: The pipeline downloads the best available mp4 (video-only, no audio). Downstream models resize frames internally (TrackNetV3 to 512x288 (W x H) per `src/shared/tracknetv3/utils/general.py`; the pose stack to 640x640 (W x H) for detection and 192x256 (W x H) per pose crop, named 256x192 upstream in HxW order), so resolutions above 720p provide no practical benefit while increasing file size and processing time.

---

### Stage 2 -- Prepare Training Data (`preparing_data/`)

The pipeline produces **video clips** and **shuttle .npy files**. BST-X does not operate on raw video -- it needs pre-extracted skeletal pose, court position, and shuttle trajectory arrays. This stage bridges the gap.

#### Module

| Module | Role | Key functions / concepts |
|--------|------|--------------------------|
| `prepare_train_on_shuttleset.py` | Runs the rtmlib pose stack on each clip to extract 2D player keypoints, combines them with shuttle trajectories at collation time, normalizes everything, and collates per-sample arrays into batch-ready `.npy` files. | Shuttle extraction and the CSV->npy conversion are owned upstream by `build_dataset` (step 6, `pipeline/shuttle_extractor.py`); this stage assumes the shuttle npys already exist under `data/shuttleset/shuttle_npy/`. **Step 1**: `prepare_dataset_npy_from_raw_video()` -- run pose estimation (rtmlib RTMDet-M + RTMPose-L), extract court positions via homography, normalize joints by bounding box, save per-clip `_joints.npy`, `_pos.npy`, `_failed.npy`. Shuttle data is intentionally not read here -- keeping this step independent of shuttle-npy availability prevents a missing npy from silently blocking the expensive GPU job. **Step 2**: `collate_npy(taxonomy=..., shuttle_npy_dir=...)` -- reads shuttle npys from the canonical `data/shuttleset/shuttle_npy/` dir (dedup + resolution-normalisation already done once at the converter), applies temporal alignment and failed-frame masking, pads all samples to uniform `seq_len`, computes bone vectors and interpolated joints, stacks into single arrays per split. The `taxonomy` parameter (a `Taxonomy` instance from `classifier_shared.taxonomy`) determines the class list for label assignment. RTMPose crops are resized internally (192x256, W x H), so video resolution does not affect pose estimation quality beyond ~720p. |

#### Setup

On the HPC nodes the collation output lives on scratch. Set `BST_X_COLLATED_DATA_ROOT` (e.g. `/scratch/comp320a/`) in `.env` and both the collator and `bst_x_train` write/read `<root>/ShuttleSet_data_<taxonomy>/<basename>/` there directly. With the env var unset, both fall back to the in-repo `preparing_data/` convention; if you'd rather keep the data on scratch under that fallback, symlink it:

```bash
# Fallback (no BST_X_COLLATED_DATA_ROOT); replace taxonomy name as needed:
mkdir -p /scratch/comp320a/ShuttleSet_data_une_v1_14
cd ~/badminton_cv_annotator/src/bst_x/preparing_data
ln -s /scratch/comp320a/ShuttleSet_data_une_v1_14 ShuttleSet_data_une_v1_14
```

If running locally or without scratch, no setup is needed -- the script creates `ShuttleSet_data_{taxonomy}/` and all subdirectories automatically.

**Taxonomy independence of pose data:** Phase-2 pose data is already flat and taxonomy-independent. `BST_X_RTMPOSE_NPY_DIR` points to `ShuttleSet_keypoints_clean_sticky_anchor/`, where each clip stem identifies one set of pose arrays. The collator applies the selected taxonomy and writes the result under `ShuttleSet_data_<taxonomy>/`.

#### CLI usage

Run from the repo root with both package roots on PYTHONPATH:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=src:src/bst_x

# Preview what would be done:
python -m preparing_data.prepare_train_on_shuttleset --dry-run

# Common case: shuttle npys already exist from the pipeline.
# Run pose only (no shuttle-npy dependency -- can run without them present):
python -m preparing_data.prepare_train_on_shuttleset --skip-collate

# Then collate (reads shuttle npys from data/shuttleset/shuttle_npy/):
python -m preparing_data.prepare_train_on_shuttleset --skip-pose

# Point to a non-default shuttle npy location:
python -m preparing_data.prepare_train_on_shuttleset --skip-pose \
    --shuttle-npy-dir /scratch/comp320a/ShuttleSet/shuttle_npy

# Full run (pose then collate; shuttle npys must already exist):
python -m preparing_data.prepare_train_on_shuttleset
```

Key flags: `--seq-len` (30 or 100), `--taxonomy` (`bst_25`, `bst_24`, `bst_12`, `une_v1_14`, `une_v1_15`, or `shuttleset_18`), `--collation-id` (required generation tag, e.g. `taxon_pinned_w_preds`), `--split-column` (`split_v2` / `split_bst_baseline`), `--skip-pose`, `--skip-collate`, `--clips-dir`, `--shuttle-npy-dir` (default: `data/shuttleset/shuttle_npy/`), `--dry-run`.

#### Running at scale

A single extraction process leaves the GPU mostly idle (37-39% measured): per-frame cost is dominated by Python and video decode, not the model. For a full re-extract, run several workers per GPU on disjoint clip shards. Measured saturation points (2026-07-06):

```
bourbaki (A100): 8 workers, OMP_NUM_THREADS=2 each  -> 38.0 ms/frame, GPU ~97%
carmack  (L40):  8 workers, OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 each  -> 27.2 ms/frame, GPU ~96%
both nodes together clear the full 33k-clip set in ~7.5 h
```

engelbart sits out: CUDA 13 dropped Volta, so the current onnxruntime-gpu build cannot open a session on its V100. Sharding mechanics (symlink dirs for this module's pose step; `raw_extract` takes a stems list natively), tmux command blocks, and the measurements behind the worker counts: [`extraction_saturation_runbook.md`](../../docs/architecture_notes/rtmlib_migration/extraction_saturation_runbook.md).

#### Data transformations in detail

1. **Pose detection** (`detect_players_2d`): the rtmlib pose stack extracts 17 COCO keypoints per frame. Players are identified by court projection of their feet -- only the two players whose feet project inside the court boundaries are kept, ordered Top-first by y-coordinate. See [`keypoints_schema.md`](preparing_data/keypoints_schema.md) for the full joint index map, bone pairs, and JnB representation details.

2. **Joint normalization** (`normalize_joints`): Keypoints are normalized relative to the player's bounding box diagonal. Optionally center-aligned.

3. **Shuttle normalization** (`normalize_shuttlecock`): Shuttle xy divided by video resolution to get [0,1] range. Done once at the converter (`pipeline/shuttle_extractor.py`), upstream of collation; collation (Step 2) just loads the saved npy. Pose-fail frames keep their shuttle values: TrackNet still sees the shuttle on frames where pose loses a player, so only TrackNet's own misses carry the (0,0) sentinel. The per-clip `_failed.npy` files (Step 1) still record the pose-fail mask for debugging or future use; collation never modifies the source npys or CSVs.

4. **Padding and augmentation** (`pad_and_derive_pose_styles`): Each sample is padded (or linspace-sampled) to a fixed `seq_len` (30 or 100 frames). Four pose representations are supported; only those passed in `--pose-styles` (default `JnB_bone`) are computed and saved:
   - `J_only`: raw joints `(t, 2, 17, 2)`
   - `JnB_interp`: joints + bone midpoints `(t, 2, 36, 2)`
   - `JnB_bone`: joints + bone vectors `(t, 2, 36, 2)` — **default**, what BST-X training loads
   - `Jn2B`: interpolated joints + bone vectors `(t, 2, 55, 2)`

5. **Collation** (`collate_npy`): All samples in a split are stacked into single arrays and saved:
   - `{pose_style}.npy` (one file per requested style), `pos.npy`, `shuttle.npy`, `videos_len.npy`, `labels.npy`

#### Collated output structure

```
preparing_data/ShuttleSet_data_{taxonomy.name}/npy_[seq{N}_]{split}_{collation_id}/
  train/
    JnB_bone.npy                                    # default single pose file
    pos.npy, shuttle.npy, videos_len.npy, labels.npy
  val/
    ...
  test/
    ...
```

Passing `--pose-styles J_only,JnB_bone,Jn2B` (etc.) saves the listed styles instead.

For example, `ShuttleSet_data_une_v1_14/`, `ShuttleSet_data_bst_25/`, or `ShuttleSet_data_shuttleset_18/`.

---

### Between Stages 2 and 3 -- Data Quality Validation (`validation_scripts/`)

Before training, run the validation scripts to assess detection quality. Two independent failure modes are invisible at training time and worth quantifying:

1. **Pose failures** (`_failed.npy`): frames where the pose step couldn't detect exactly 2 players. Joints, court positions, and shuttle coordinates are all zeroed on these frames at collation. The BST-X transformer does **not** mask them -- they participate in attention as zero vectors.

2. **Shuttle detection failures** (shuttle NPY visibility column): frames where TrackNetV3 reported visibility=0. The visibility column is dropped during collation, so these failures become silent (0, 0) shuttle coordinates with no way for the model to distinguish them from a shuttle at the origin.

#### Usage

Run from the repository root (rtmlib or BST venv -- only needs numpy, matplotlib, pandas):

```bash
# Minimal (current Phase-2 pose failure stats only):
python src/bst_x/validation_scripts/validate_zeroed_frames.py \
    --data-root /scratch/comp320a/ShuttleSet_keypoints_clean_sticky_anchor \
    --dataset-npy-dir /scratch/comp320a/ShuttleSet_keypoints_clean_sticky_anchor \
    --split-column split_v2 \
    --taxonomy une_v1_14

# Full (adds flaw cross-reference, hit-frame proximity, shuttle analysis):
python src/bst_x/validation_scripts/validate_zeroed_frames.py \
    --data-root /scratch/comp320a/ShuttleSet_keypoints_clean_sticky_anchor \
    --dataset-npy-dir /scratch/comp320a/ShuttleSet_keypoints_clean_sticky_anchor \
    --split-column split_v2 \
    --taxonomy une_v1_14 \
    --set-dir data/shuttleset/set \
    --shuttle-npy-dir /scratch/comp320a/ShuttleSet/shuttle_npy_flat
```

Optional flags: `--threshold` (flagged-clip cutoff, default 0.5), `--hit-window` (frames either side of hit, default 10), `--taxonomy` (for label derivation and output filenames, default `une_v1_14`).

#### Output

All saved to `validation_scripts/zeroed_frames_analysis_outputs/`:

- **Text report** (`analysis_{taxonomy}_{date}_{time}.txt`): overall/per-split/per-stroke failure rates, tiered clip counts, flaw cross-reference, shuttle detection stats with pose x shuttle 2x2 overlap, hit-frame proximity breakdown for both pose and shuttle.
- **Figures**: fail rate histogram (log y-axis), temporal pattern by clip position, hit-frame profile (pose vs shuttle overlay).

See `validation_scripts/README.md` for full argument and report section documentation.

### Stage 3 -- Dataset Loading (`preparing_data/shuttleset_dataset.py`)

Bridges collated `.npy` files to PyTorch `DataLoader`s. Uses `Taxonomy` from `classifier_shared.taxonomy` for class list construction.

#### Key classes and functions

| Name | Role |
|------|------|
| `Dataset_npy_collated` | Primary Dataset class for BST-X. Loads pre-collated arrays from disk. Supports `train_partial` to use a fraction of training data. Returns `(human_pose, pos, shuttle), video_len, label` per sample. **Filters out zero-length clips at load time** (see known divergence below). |
| `prepare_npy_collated_loaders()` | Convenience function: creates train/val/test `DataLoader`s from a collated directory. |
| `make_seq_len_same()` | Pads short samples or linspace-samples long ones to match `seq_len`. Used by `collate_npy`. |
| `create_bones()` / `interpolate_joints()` | Bone vector and midpoint computation from joint arrays. |
| `POSE_BONE_MULTIPLIER` | Dict mapping pose style names to bone-set multipliers: `{'J_only': 0, 'JnB_bone': 1, 'JnB_interp': 1, 'Jn2B': 2}`. Used by train/infer scripts to compute `in_dim`. |
| `pad_class_labels()` | Pads class label strings to uniform width for aligned F1 display. |
| `CoupledFlip` / `ConstrainedJitter` | Live augmentations (in `preparing_data/augmentations.py`): centreline flip across all three streams (with COCO bilateral swap + bone recompute) plus constrained pos+shuttle jitter (layered bounds, joints untouched). Hardcoded to `pose_style=JnB_bone`. The earlier `RandomTranslation_batch` is gone. |

#### Known divergence: zero-length clip filtering

`Dataset_npy_collated` drops clips with `videos_len == 0` at load time.

**Background:** Our automated pipeline processes all clips from ShuttleSet, including degenerate ones where pose detection fails to find 2 players on every single frame. These clips end up with `videos_len=0` after collation — the entire sample is zero-padded with no real frames. When the transformer builds its padding mask, all positions are masked out, causing `softmax(all -inf) = NaN`, which poisons the loss and the entire training run.

#### Tensor shapes at model input

```
human_pose:  (batch, seq_len, 2, n_pose_features, 2)  ->  flattened to (batch, seq_len, 2, in_dim)
pos:         (batch, seq_len, 2, 2)
shuttle:     (batch, seq_len, 2)
video_len:   (batch,)
labels:      (batch,)
```

#### Loading clip video frames (`pipeline/clip_index.py`)

`Dataset_npy_collated` covers pose + shuttle + position streams from the npy collated dir. For any model that also needs the raw `.mp4` clip frames (Arch 2 3D CNN, Arch 1 wrist crop), the clips directory is still nested as `{split}/{Top,Bottom}_{stroke_type}/*.mp4` (Phase 3 flattening is deferred). Rather than walk the tree per `__getitem__`, use `pipeline.clip_index.build_clip_path_index(clips_dir)` to build a `{clip_stem -> Path}` lookup once at Dataset `__init__`; subsequent per-sample lookup is O(1).

Skeleton showing the CSV-driven pattern (split + label come from `clips_master.csv` with taxonomy applied at init, matching how `collate_npy` builds its npy arrays):

```python
import pandas as pd
from torch.utils.data import Dataset

from pipeline.clip_index import build_clip_path_index
from classifier_shared.taxonomy import TAXONOMIES
from pipeline.config import CLIPS_OUTPUT_DIR


class ClipVideoDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, clips_csv, split_column, taxonomy_name,
                 split='train', clips_dir=CLIPS_OUTPUT_DIR):
        df = pd.read_csv(clips_csv)
        df = df[df[split_column] == split]
        taxonomy = TAXONOMIES[taxonomy_name]
        self._path_by_stem = build_clip_path_index(clips_dir)
        self.items = [
            (row.clip_stem, _derive_label(row, taxonomy))
            for row in df.itertuples()
        ]

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.items)

    def __getitem__(self, i):
        stem, label = self.items[i]
        return load_video(self._path_by_stem[stem]), label
```

`derive_class_index(taxonomy, row.raw_type_en, row.player_side)` produces the int label (or `None` to skip the row), applying the taxonomy's merge map + side rule + exclusions in one place; see `collate_npy` in `prepare_train_on_shuttleset.py` for the canonical reference implementation. The video decoder (`load_video`) is caller's choice — cv2, decord, or torchvision.io. With this pattern the nested `clips/` layout stays transparent: any `split_column` in `clips_master.csv` (e.g. `split_bst_baseline`, `split_v2`) works without reorganizing the clips tree.

For ad-hoc queries or when a Dataset wants a higher-level "give me clip + shuttle + pose triples for this split and class" API, `pipeline.data_access.get_clip_records` wraps the CSV read, taxonomy label derivation, and flat-path resolution into one call (and exposes the same thing via CLI / TUI at `python -m pipeline.data_access`). `clip_index.build_clip_path_index` remains the zero-dep pathlib helper it calls internally for clip-stem lookup.

### Stage 4 -- Model (`model/`)

#### Modules

| Module | Role |
|--------|------|
| `tempose.py` | Building blocks reused by BST-X: `TCN` (dilated 1D temporal convolutions), `MLP`, `MLP_Head` (LayerNorm + MLP), `FeedForward` (MLP + Dropout), `MultiHeadAttention`, `TransformerLayer`, `TransformerEncoder`. The four standalone TemPose variants (`TemPose_V`/`PF`/`SF`/`TF`) were excised pre-phase-2 and live verbatim in `docs/architecture_notes/historical_bst.md` section 1. |
| `bst.py` | The BST-X model. Imports `TCN`, `FeedForward`, `MLP`, `MLP_Head`, `TransformerEncoder` from `tempose.py`. Adds `MultiHeadCrossAttention` and `CrossTransformerLayer` for player-shuttle interaction. Exposes `BST_CG_AP` as a plain alias of the one `BST` graph (PPF, CG and AP always on), imported unchanged by the train/infer scripts. |

#### BST-X architecture (forward pass)

1. **PPF (Pose Position Fusion)** -- optional: projects court positions to `in_dim` via MLP, multiplies with skeleton features (multiplicative fusion with residual).
2. **TCN feature extraction**: separate TCNs for pose `(b*n, in_dim, t) -> (b*n, d_model, t)` and shuttle `(b, 2, t) -> (b, d_model, t)`.
3. **Temporal Transformer**: each of the 3 streams (player1, player2, shuttle) gets a learnable CLS token prepended, positional embeddings added, then processed by shared self-attention layers independently. Padding mask prevents attention to zero-padded frames.
4. **Cross Transformer**: each player's frame-level representation attends to the shuttle's representation via cross-attention (player queries, shuttle provides keys+values).
5. **Interactional Transformer**: combines player-shuttle interactions across players with another CLS token and self-attention.
6. **CG (Clean Gate)** -- optional: subtracts shared player noise from shuttle CLS via learned MLP. Scaled by `cg_factor` buffer (see CG/AP warm-start schedule below).
7. **AP (Aim Player)** -- optional: weights player contributions by cosine similarity to shuttle CLS. Alpha multipliers blend toward pass-through via `ap_factor` buffer (see CG/AP warm-start schedule below).
8. **MLP Head**: concatenated CLS tokens -> LayerNorm -> MLP -> class logits.

#### CG/AP warm-start schedule (BST_CG_AP only)

A cosine schedule fades CG and AP out across training so the transformer backbone takes over. The model holds two scalar buffers (`cg_factor`, `ap_factor`, both in `[0, 1]`) that modulate the two optional blocks:

- CG: `shuttle_cls = shuttle_cls - cg_factor * dirt`. At `cg_factor=0` the subtraction vanishes.
- AP: `eff_a_p1 = ap_factor * alpha + (1 - ap_factor)`, `eff_a_p2 = ap_factor * (1 - alpha) + (1 - ap_factor)`. At `ap_factor=0` both multipliers become exactly 1.0 (`p1_conclusion` and `p2_conclusion` pass through unchanged). At `ap_factor=1` the original AP gating is recovered.

The training loop calls `model.set_schedule_factors(cg_factor, ap_factor)` once per epoch with a factor from `aux_schedule_factor(epoch, fade_end_epoch)` (cosine from 1.0 at epoch 1 to 0.0 at `fade_end_epoch`, pinned at 0 after). CG and AP currently share one factor. The buffers are part of `state_dict`, so the best-F1 checkpoint captures whichever value was active at that epoch; `task.test()` runs with those restored values, no override. Controls live in the `hyp` namedtuple in `bst_x_train.py` (see Stage 5).

#### BST variants

One graph now: PPF, CG and AP always run. `BST_CG_AP` stays as a plain alias of `BST` so the registry and train/infer scripts import an unchanged name.

```python
BST_CG_AP = BST  # PPF/CG/AP always on; the one graph the project trains
```

The old `use_ppf` / `use_cg` / `use_ap` flags and the `BST_0` / `BST_PPF` / `BST_CG` / `BST_AP` partials came out when CG and AP went always-on; their wiring lives in `docs/archive/completed_general_refactors/structure_and_guards_pass/bst_variant_flags_design.md`.

#### Key hyperparameters (defaults from `bst_x_train.py`)

| Parameter | Default | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| `d_model` | 100 | Hidden dimension throughout |
| `d_head` | 128 | Dimension per attention head |
| `n_head` | 6 | Number of attention heads |
| `depth_tem` | 2 | Temporal transformer layers |
| `depth_inter` | 1 | Interactional transformer layers |
| `drop_p` | 0.3 | Dropout rate |
| `tcn_kernel_size` | 5 | TCN convolution kernel |

---

### Stage 5 -- Training

Stage 5 spans two files:

- `bst_x_train.py` — top-level training loop (`Hyp`, `train_one_epoch`, `validate`, `train_network`, `Task`).
- `bst_x_common.py` — shared scaffolding lifted out by step 5c so `bst_x_train.py` and `bst_x_infer.py` agree on a single source of truth (`MODELS`, `build_bst_x_network`, `Tee`, `compute_data_provenance`).

#### Key components

| Name | Lives in | Role |
|------|----------|------|
| `Hyp` (namedtuple) | `bst_x_train.py` | Active training config, in the `Hyp`/`hyp` block near the top of `bst_x_train.py`.<br>• Schedule: `n_epochs=80`, `early_stop_n_epochs=40`, `warm_up_step=100`, `use_aux_schedule=True`, `aux_fade_end_epoch=15` (compressed warm-start-then-finetune, paired with the CG/AP cosine fade).<br>• Data: `taxonomy='une_v1_14'`, `split_column='split_v2'`, `collation_id='taxon_pinned_w_preds'`, `seq_len=100`, `pose_style='JnB_bone'`, `train_partial=1.0`.<br>• Optim: `batch_size=128`, `lr=5e-4`.<br>• `ablation_id` is a nullable training-time tag, separate from the `collation_id` path tag. `drop_unknown`/`expected_active_classes` were removed in the taxon_pinned_w_preds refactor: `excluded_base_stroke_types` carries the unknown-drop rule and labels.npy lands in active class space.<br>• BST-paper originals (`n_epochs=1600`, `warm_up_step=400`, `early_stop_n_epochs=300`, `taxonomy='merged_25'`, `aux_fade_end_epoch=60`) live verbatim in `historical_bst.md`; current LR + schedule rationale in `bst_x_overview.md`. |
| `train_one_epoch()` | `bst_x_train.py` | Standard PyTorch training loop: forward pass, cross-entropy loss (with label smoothing 0.1), backward, optimizer step, scheduler step. Applies the live augmentations (`CoupledFlip` then `ConstrainedJitter`) per batch and accumulates per-class TP/FP/FN counts via `accumulate_class_counts` for downstream `AdaptiveFocalLoss.update_alpha`. |
| `validate()` | `bst_x_train.py` | Evaluates on val set. Accumulates per-class TP/FP/FN across batches, computes macro F1 and min-class F1. |
| `Task.test()` | `bst_x_train.py` | Derives top-1 macro/min F1 + accuracy from a precomputed test-split dump (no second forward pass); returns a metrics dict. |
| `Task.test_topk_acc()` | `bst_x_train.py` | Derives top-k accuracy from the dump's raw logits via a fresh `torch.topk(k)`; returns `{f'top{k}_accuracy': ...}`. |
| `Task.dump_predictions()` | `bst_x_train.py` | Runs each split through one shuffle=False forward pass, writes the per-split prediction npz (logits + y_true + top-k + clip_stems), and returns the per-split dumps so `Task.test()` / `Task.test_topk_acc()` can reuse the test dump. |
| `train_network()` | `bst_x_train.py` | Full training loop with AdamW optimizer, cosine LR schedule with warmup, early stopping on macro F1, and best-checkpoint saving. Applies the CG/AP warm-start schedule at the top of each epoch via `model.set_schedule_factors(cg_factor, ap_factor)`. Logs per-epoch scalars (`Loss/Train`, `Loss/Val`, `F1/Val_macro`, `F1/Val_min`, `Schedule/aux_factor`) plus an end-of-run **HParams** entry: best + 2nd-best macro F1 and min F1 (with their epochs), best val loss (with epoch), and `stopped_epoch`. `stopped_epoch - best/macro_f1_epoch == early_stop_n_epochs` confirms a clean early-stop vs a crash. |
| `Task` (class) | `bst_x_train.py` | Orchestrates the full workflow: `prepare_dataloaders()` -> `get_network_architecture()` -> `seek_network_weights()` (loads existing or trains) -> `test()`. |
| `MODELS` (dict) | `bst_x_common.py` | Maps model names (`'BST_CG_AP'`, `'BST_X'`) to the one `BST` graph imported from `model/bst.py`, with a commented `'BST_X_RGB'` placeholder parked for the X3D-S fusion variant. Single dispatch point shared by `bst_x_train.py` and `bst_x_infer.py`. |
| `build_bst_x_network()` | `bst_x_common.py` | Builds the network from `MODELS[name]` and returns `(net, n_bones)`. `n_bones` is the trailing-bone-channel count derived from `pose_style` x `get_bone_pairs()` and is the single source of truth used downstream. |
| `Tee` (class) | `bst_x_common.py` | Duplicates writes across multiple streams (terminal + file). Used by `bst_x_train.py`'s `__main__` to auto-tee test output to `test_logs/test_<timestamp>.log` so test metrics survive a dropped terminal. Training output stays terminal-only (TB has it). |
| `compute_data_provenance()` | `bst_x_common.py` | Hashes `clips_master.csv` + collated-dir naming into the `extra:` block of the manifest so each run is rebindable to its exact data input. |

#### Training flow

```
Task(taxonomy, hyp)
  .prepare_dataloaders(root_dir)
  .get_network_architecture(model_name='BST_CG_AP')
  .seek_network_weights(model_info, serial_no)   # trains if no checkpoint found
  dumps = .dump_predictions(run_dir, serial_no, k=5)   # one forward pass per split
  .test(dump=dumps['test'], show_details, show_confusion_matrix)
  .test_topk_acc(dump=dumps['test'], k=2)
```

The `__main__` block runs 5 serial trials (`range(1, 6)`) to measure seed variance. Each invocation mints one timestamp and uses it to name both (a) the run folder `experiments/run_<timestamp>/` (holding `manifest.yaml`, `weights/`, and `tb/serial_N/`) and (b) the test log `test_logs/test_<timestamp>.log`, so artefacts for a single invocation line up on disk. All five serials' weights, per-serial TB event dirs, and test output land under that run folder. `Task.test()` and `task.test_topk_acc()` are wrapped in `redirect_stdout(Tee(sys.stdout, log_f))` so test metrics land in both the terminal and the log file. The script is wired into `run_tracker.py` with two function calls (`track_run` + `track_serial`) so the manifest captures hparams + per-serial metrics automatically; see the **Run tracker + aggregator** section below. Set `resume_from = '<run_folder_name>'` at the top of `__main__` to re-test an existing run's weights without retraining; leave it `None` for normal fresh-train behaviour.

#### Outputs

Every invocation writes under `experiments/bst_x/shuttleset/<run_id>/`, where `<run_id>` is `run_<timestamp>` on a fresh run or the `resume_from` folder name on a re-test. That folder is the single collection point: manifest + per-serial weights + per-serial TB dirs all live side by side.

- **Manifest** (`experiments/bst_x/shuttleset/<run_id>/manifest.yaml`): source of truth for hparams, git SHA + host, per-serial metrics (`macro_f1`, `min_f1`, `accuracy`, `top2_accuracy`, `num_strokes`), paths to each serial's weight file and TB dir, plus a `log_path:` pointer back to the matching test log. Tracked in git.
- **Best-model notes** (`experiments/bst_x/shuttleset/<run_id>/best_model_id.txt`): freeform notes flagging the best-performing serial(s) and the config context, written by hand after eyeballing the test log. Tracked in git alongside the manifest.
- **Model weights** (`experiments/bst_x/shuttleset/<run_id>/weights/bst_x_..._une_v1_14[_N].pt`): one best-validation-F1 checkpoint per serial. Gitignored by default; `experiments/bst_x/shuttleset/.gitignore` carries a per-run tactical `!` unignore for the serial(s) flagged in `best_model_id.txt`, so git history stays small while the best checkpoints are still shareable.
- **TensorBoard logs** (`experiments/bst_x/shuttleset/<run_id>/tb/serial_N/`): per-serial event directories grouped under one run folder. Launch with `tensorboard --logdir experiments/bst_x/shuttleset/<run_id>/tb` to see all serials of a run in one view. Each subfolder holds **two** event files: a larger one (60-70 KB) with the per-epoch scalar curves (train/val loss, val macro/min F1, `Schedule/aux_factor`) and a tiny one (~1.6 KB) with the end-of-run HParams summary (best/2nd-best macro F1 and min F1, best val loss, their epochs, `stopped_epoch`). Gitignored.
- **Test logs** (`test_logs/test_<timestamp>.log`): all serials' test-set output (`=== Serial N (...) ===` headers, macro F1 table, accuracy, top-2 accuracy) auto-captured via the `Tee` class so metrics survive a dropped terminal. One file per script invocation; the run's manifest points at it via `log_path:`. Grep with `grep -E 'Accuracy|macro' test_logs/test_*.log` for a quick summary across runs, or use `run_overview.py` for a proper tabulation.

#### Run tracker + aggregator

Cross-run comparison and the optional Aim UI are handled by the YAML-based tracker at `src/bst_x/run_tracker.py`. `bst_x_train.py` wires it in with two function calls (`track_run` + `track_serial`), so any future training script (Arch 2 3D CNN, or any further extension) can plug in the same way. Full details in [`src/bst_x/run_tracker.md`](run_tracker.md).

- **`run_overview.py`** aggregates every `experiments/bst_x/shuttleset/<run_id>/manifest.yaml` into one table with mean / stdev / max per metric across serials:
  ```bash
  cd src/bst_x
  python ../run_overview.py                              # default: experiments/
  python ../run_overview.py -c n_epochs,use_aux_schedule -m macro_f1,min_f1
  ```
- **`aim_backfill.py`** rebuilds the Aim UI from every manifest + its TB event files: per-epoch curves, per-class final F1, hparams, auto-derived tags (`legacy`, the anneal-regime label, and `best` on the serial whose checkpoint was kept), and each run dated to its `started_at` rather than backfill-import time. Re-running needs `--wipe` (it removes `.aim` and rebuilds from scratch): aim 3.29 can't reopen a stable run hash, and an in-place update bleeds tags between runs. Runs in the tb-viewer venv (aim + tensorboard); `--repo` points at the Aim repo. Filter the kept-checkpoint runs in the UI search bar with `'best' in run.tags`.
  ```bash
  ~/.venvs/tb-viewer/bin/python ../aim_backfill.py \
      --repo /path/to/.aim_repos/bst --wipe experiments
  ~/.venvs/tb-viewer/bin/aim up --repo /path/to/.aim_repos/bst   # UI at http://localhost:43800
  ```
  The live `track_serial` mirror (above) also writes to Aim when aim is importable, creating a fresh run per call; `aim_backfill.py --wipe` is the canonical, idempotent population.

## Part 2: Adapting for a Custom (Non-BST-X) Model

### What stays the same

- **The entire `pipeline/` directory.** The pipeline produces labeled video clips and shuttle trajectories. It is model-agnostic -- it doesn't know or care what architecture consumes its output.
- **`classifier_shared/taxonomy.py`** is the single source of truth for stroke types, class labels, and merge rules. Your custom dataset loader should import taxonomy definitions from here to stay in sync.
- **`pipeline/config.py`** provides dataset paths, splits, and pipeline settings.
- **`result_utils.py`** works with any model that produces `(predictions, ground_truth)` tensors. `show_f1_results()` and `plot_confusion_matrix()` are architecture-agnostic.

### What changes or may be replaced

#### 1. Data preparation (`prepare_train_on_shuttleset.py`)

This is the most likely point of divergence.

- **If your model operates on raw video** (e.g. a video transformer, 3D CNN, or SlowFast): you can skip pose estimation entirely. Load clips directly from `data/shuttleset/clips/` using a standard video DataLoader. The folder structure already encodes labels via directory names (`{Player}_{stroke_type}`).

- **If your model uses different input features**: you may need different preprocessing. For example, optical flow, different skeleton formats (not COCO-17), or different normalization schemes. Write your own preparation script, but reuse `classifier_shared.taxonomy` for label definitions.

- **If your model uses pose but at different granularity**: the existing `collate_npy()` supports 4 pose styles (J_only, JnB_interp, JnB_bone, Jn2B). If these suffice, you can reuse the collated arrays directly. If not (e.g., you need raw unnormalized keypoints, or a different skeleton topology), modify the preparation step.

#### 2. Dataset class (`shuttleset_dataset.py`)

BST-X's dataset classes return a specific tuple format: `(human_pose, pos, shuttle), video_len, label`.

- **If your model expects different inputs**: write a new Dataset class. Key decisions:
  - Does your model need all 3 input streams (pose, position, shuttle)? BST-X uses all three. TemPose variants use subsets.
  - Does your model handle variable-length sequences internally (e.g. via packed sequences or attention masks), or does it need pre-padded fixed-length input? BST-X uses fixed-length padding + a `video_len` mask.
  - Does your model operate on pre-collated batched arrays, or per-clip files? `Dataset_npy_collated` loads pre-collated arrays into RAM at init; if a future model needs lazy per-clip loading, write a new Dataset (the legacy `Dataset_npy` lazy loader was excised pre-phase-2; the verbatim source is in `docs/architecture_notes/historical_bst.md` section 4.1).

- **Label list construction**: All class labels are English. Read `taxonomy.classes` from any `Taxonomy` in `classifier_shared.taxonomy.TAXONOMIES`, or call `taxonomy_lookup(name)`. Labels.npy lands in `[0, taxonomy.n_classes)` directly. BST-X taxonomies are `'bst_25'`, `'bst_24'`, `'bst_12'`, `'une_v1_14'` (Architecture 1 active), `'une_v1_15'`, and `'shuttleset_18'`. Define new classifier taxonomies in `classifier_shared/taxonomy.py`.

#### 3. Model architecture (`model/`)

Replace `bst.py` (and optionally `tempose.py`) with your own architecture.

- **Reusable building blocks from `tempose.py`**: `TCN`, `MLP`, `MLP_Head`, `FeedForward`, `TransformerEncoder` are generic components. If your custom model is transformer-based, you can import these directly rather than reimplementing.

- **BST-X-specific components you'd replace**: `MultiHeadCrossAttention`, `CrossTransformerLayer`, and the BST-X `forward()` logic (PPF, CG, AP). These encode BST-X's specific inductive biases about player-shuttle interaction.

- **Input contract**: BST-X's `forward()` expects `(JnB, shuttle, pos, video_len)`. Your model defines its own signature. The dataset class and training loop must agree on this contract.

#### 4. Training script (`bst_x_train.py`)

The training loop is tightly coupled to BST-X's input format and hyperparameters.

- **Reusable patterns**: The overall structure (train/validate/test functions, early stopping, cosine LR schedule, TensorBoard logging, `Task` orchestration pattern) can be adapted.

- **What to change**:
  - The `Hyp` namedtuple values (learning rate, batch size, epochs, etc.)
  - The model construction in `get_network_architecture()` (replace BST-X with your model)
  - The data unpacking in `train_one_epoch()` and `validate()` (the `for (human_pose, pos, shuttle), video_len, labels in loader` destructuring must match your Dataset's return format)
  - The bone-aware augmentation logic (lines 88-95 of `train_one_epoch`) -- this is BST-X-specific

#### 5. Inference script (`bst_x_infer.py`)

Same pattern as training: replace the model construction and data unpacking to match your architecture.

### Summary of divergence points

| Stage | BST-X-specific? | Custom model action |
|-------|--------------|---------------------|
| Pipeline (`pipeline/`) | No | Reuse as-is |
| Pose extraction (`prepare_train_on_shuttleset.py`) | Partially | Replace if your model uses different features (raw video, optical flow, etc.) |
| Dataset class (`shuttleset_dataset.py`) | Yes | Write new Dataset matching your model's input contract |
| Model (`bst.py` + `tempose.py`) | Yes | Replace with your architecture; optionally reuse tempose building blocks |
| Training loop (`bst_x_train.py`) | Yes | Adapt the loop structure; change data unpacking, model init, augmentation |
| Results (`result_utils.py`) | No | Reuse as-is |
