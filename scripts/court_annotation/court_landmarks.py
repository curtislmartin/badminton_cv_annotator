"""Badminton court model for hand annotation: named line intersections and homography fits.

Court dimensions are fixed by the BWF, so any four or more clicked line
intersections with known court coordinates pin the court-to-image homography.
Projecting a corner's court coordinates through that homography gives its pixel
position even when the corner lies beyond the visible frame. That is the whole
trick behind off-frame ground truth: the visible markings determine where the
unseen corner must be.

Convention matches ``shared.court_model``: court metres,
origin at the TL corner, x across the 6.10 m width, y down-court along the
13.40 m length, corner slots ordered TL TR BR BL. "Far" and "near" describe the
view on screen (far baseline = the one at the top of a normal court view). The
court is symmetric end to end, so any consistent far/near reading of a frame
yields a valid homography. Constants are duplicated here rather than imported
from ``shared.court_model``, so this module needs no repository imports.
