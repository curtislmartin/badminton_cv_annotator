"""Retired tour annotator: helpers, sessions, and fit maths live on; the GUI is gone.

The runnable GUI retired on 2026-07-12 per docs/annotator_unification_brief.md;
``annotate_court_corners_offframe.py`` is THE court corner annotator (it grafted
this tool's point floor, reprojection gate, quad sanity check, loupe guard,
launch help, and window robustness). What remains here is everything other code
still imports:

- the loupe coordinate maths and ``render_loupe``/``read_frame``, which the
  off-frame tool reuses
- the corners-CSV and points-sidecar helpers (both formats stay byte-compatible
  with the saved hand-corner sets)
- ``build_point_table`` and the court-plan chain
- ``fit_corner_quad`` with its gates, and both capture state machines, pinned by
  ``tests/test_court_annotation.py`` (including the torch-free regression)

The corners CSV stays the frontend CourtBoundaryStep contract: normalised xy,
any click order (the scorer re-sorts to TL TR BR BL), an orientation flag, one
row per corner::

    video,frame,corner_idx,x_px,y_px,x_norm,y_norm,orientation

Torch is never imported on this module's chain.
