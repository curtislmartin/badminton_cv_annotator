Usage: [REPO=owner/name] [TAG=models-v1] ./scripts/publish-models.sh

Steps performed:
  1. Fill scripts/model_manifest.tsv sha256 column from the local weight files.
  2. Create the release TAG on REPO (skips if it already exists).
  3. Upload each manifest weight as a release asset under its asset_name.

After it finishes, commit the updated manifest yourself, and the next team
fetches with:
  MODELS_BASE_URL=https://github.com/REPO/releases/download/TAG ./scripts/fetch-models.sh
