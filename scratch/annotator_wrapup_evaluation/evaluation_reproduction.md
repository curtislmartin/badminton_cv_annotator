## Investigation sequence

| Question | How it was checked |
|---|---|
| Which parts of the annotation are wrong? | Counted missed and extra hits, wrong players and incomplete rallies; compared clips kept and discarded by selection. |
| Do the labels refer to the action on screen? | Checked the game and score, then inspected individual hits and players in sampled footage. |
| Were court and player inputs available when contacts were missed? | Compared saved inputs at matched and missed contact times, then inspected failures and successful controls. |
| Can a bad court outline cause these failures? | Replayed the court and player decisions, then changed only the outline in the checked cases. |
| What did the learned contact work improve? | Scored the ordinary heuristic against the same labels and compared their errors. |
| How much do videos 15 and 53 affect the totals? | Recounted the same outputs with each video exclusion. |

The counts show where errors occur. Footage checks test whether the labels and pipeline decisions agree with visible play. Changing only the court outline tests its effect on the checked decisions; it does not measure how many full rallies a repaired pipeline would recover.

The detector stayed fixed during the investigation. Production wiring and automatic exact approval stayed unchanged. Earlier rejected detector experiments are recorded in [last_followups.md](last_followups.md).

### 2. Recount all 47 ShuttleSet22 videos

The evaluator rescored the saved output over 47 previously examined ShuttleSet22 videos with cleaned/all-source labels and ±10/±5-frame tolerances. It reproduced the previous headline totals.

Historical ±10 result: **1,763 / 3,422** cleaned rallies fully correct; **33,716 / 38,218** cleaned contacts timing-matched.

That 47-video aggregate is now historical because video 15 is known-bad ground truth.

### 3. Check videos 15 and 53 against the footage

An eight-window pilot targeted the two worst-looking videos: five windows in video 15 and three in video 53.

Video 15 immediately showed a label/footage mismatch. Video 53 showed ordinary badminton and needed another explanation.

Five more video-15 windows were then chosen for strong timing matches. All five still showed the wrong game or score, including both rallies where every cleaned label had a nearby detected hit.

Result: **exclude video 15; keep investigating video 53.**

### 4. Sample upstream failures and controls

Seed `20260906` selected eight missed middle contacts outside video 15:

- four from court-rejected scenes;
- two from accepted scenes with a missing player pick;
- two from accepted scenes with both players.

Each miss was paired with a successful control from the same video, chosen by nearest rally length and then time. Random IDs hid the detector state from the visual reader. Each request showed nine frames at half-second intervals across ±2 seconds.

All 16 centre frames showed the whole court and both players. The four deliberately sampled court-rejected failures showed ongoing exchanges.

This proves false court rejection exists; it does not estimate its prevalence. One successful control also exposed a weakness in the saved scene cuts: the camera visibly changes within the four-second window even though the nearest saved cut is 11.6 seconds away.

### 5. Replay the court and player logic

Three checks isolated geometry rather than retraining anything.

**Court votes:** original two-player vote arrays were reproduced exactly in four rejected scenes and four controls. Replacing only the outline with the existing same-video shared outline made videos 12, 20 and 53 pass the 50% threshold; video 21 rose to 48.9% and still failed.

**Video 17 player replay:** the original sequential tracker reproduced both saved player-validity fields at all 91,970 saved feature rows. In two failures, replacing only the undersized shared outline with the scene's own outline restored the far-player pick while keeping incoming state fixed.

**Video 53 corner replay:** rerunning the neural-net court model reproduced the saved OpenCV fallback within 0.02 pixels. The top-right neural-net corner still failed the confidence threshold.

Result: two court-geometry failure mechanisms are confirmed. No repaired end-to-end pipeline has been run yet.

### 6. Compare the ordinary heuristic

Saved ordinary heuristic outputs were rescored over the same videos without rerunning vision.

At ±10, the heuristic has **4** fully correct cleaned rallies; the learned output has **1,763**. Outside video 15, the learned path finds **5,200** labels the heuristic misses and loses **660** that the heuristic finds.

Result: keep the learned path. Its improvements make the shared upstream court problem much more prominent in the remaining error.

### 7. Recount exclusions and inspect weak videos

Saved outputs were recounted for:

- all 47 videos;
- 46 without video 15;
- 45 without videos 15 and 53.

A later 53-window review covered 19 videos, including 24 random misses, seven weak videos, extra video 53 checks and successful controls.

Removing video 15 gives the useful 46-video read. Removing video 53 raises percentages but also removes valid successful output, so it remains a sensitivity check only.

The game/score review found no second large wrong-rally mismatch outside video 15.

### 8. Publish the follow-up decisions

Commit [`8a8562e`](https://github.com/ahalp90/badminton_cv_annotator/commit/8a8562e26a9286ad491c3935f3860db66b91b020) published:

- [#147 — exclude ShuttleSet22 video 15 and check both datasets for bad labels](https://github.com/ahalp90/badminton_cv_annotator/issues/147)
- [#148 — fix court corrections that make the outline worse](https://github.com/ahalp90/badminton_cv_annotator/issues/148)

Issue #147 later added direct hit/player judgements for the random missed-contact sample:

- 16 agree with the visible hit and player;
- three clear footage disagreements, all video 15;
- one mistimed label in video 12;
- four unclear.

Four random video 53 misses also agree with the labels.

Those direct judgements supersede the earlier game/score-only status for the same cases. The saved detector metrics did not change.

The same follow-up recounted the final output on 32 original-ShuttleSet development videos. It reproduced 1,209 / 2,691 fully correct rallies at ±10 frames. [Video checks](video_checks.md#original-shuttleset) summarises the result and the eight videos still awaiting final-chooser inputs.

Evaluation work began at commit `139f42c`. The cached prediction bundle records producer commit `ba24a95c334300c78e30a8d1b7c2a6134b8b5fa9`. The court, rally-evidence, sticky-player and vision-loading implementations used by this evaluation were unchanged between those commits. The final saved contact stream is the accepted closing-pass output above, **not** the rejected corrected-target refit documented in [last_followups.md](last_followups.md).

The published investigation is recorded at [`8a8562e26a9286ad491c3935f3860db66b91b020`](https://github.com/ahalp90/badminton_cv_annotator/commit/8a8562e26a9286ad491c3935f3860db66b91b020). The local follow-up records below add direct contact judgements and the original-ShuttleSet recount.

## Baseline recount and context

```bash
python -m scratch.annotator_wrapup_evaluation.scripts.evaluate_saved \
  --annotations "$ANNOTATIONS" \
  --output scratch/annotator_wrapup_evaluation/results

python -m scratch.annotator_wrapup_evaluation.scripts.collect_context \
  --annotations "$ANNOTATIONS" \
  --prepared-root "$PREPARED" \
  --inpainted-root "$INPAINTED" \
  --saved-root "$SAVED_PREDICTIONS" \
  --output scratch/annotator_wrapup_evaluation/results

python -m scratch.annotator_wrapup_evaluation.scripts.plot_evaluation
python -m scratch.annotator_wrapup_evaluation.scripts.summarise_errors
python -m scratch.annotator_wrapup_evaluation.scripts.summarise_context
```

Matching rules:

- a contact identity includes video, rally and source-label index;
- repeated label timestamps stay as distinct rows;
- join frame context many-to-one rather than collapsing repeated labels;
- full-stream matching and matching within one proposed clip answer different questions;
- a one-contact rally counts as a serve only;
- blank exact-feature fields mean no saved feature row at that frame, not “player absent”;
- `nearest_saved_row_distance` searches only ±10 frames; a blank value means no row in that window;
- tracker coverage refers to the original saved tracking segments;
- a saved scene-exclusion decision is an algorithmic state, not a human replay label;
- shuttle visibility means a filled coordinate exists, not that the coordinate is accurate;
- surrounding-window fractions use the half-open interval `[frame-15, frame+15)`;
- `population=retained` means cleaned labels and `population=all_gt` means all source labels; neither means that selection kept the proposal.

## Visual sample and court/player checks

Create the controlled sample and source sheets:

```bash
python -m scratch.annotator_wrapup_evaluation.scripts.sample_context

python -m scratch.annotator_wrapup_evaluation.scripts.extract_views \
  --sample scratch/annotator_wrapup_evaluation/results/visual_sample.csv.gz \
  --sources "$SOURCES" \
  --output scratch/annotator_wrapup_evaluation/raw/control_sheets

python -m scratch.annotator_wrapup_evaluation.scripts.extract_views \
  --sample scratch/annotator_wrapup_evaluation/results/visual_pilot.csv.gz \
  --sources "$SOURCES" \
  --output scratch/annotator_wrapup_evaluation/raw/pilot_sheets

python -m scratch.annotator_wrapup_evaluation.scripts.plot_examples

python -m scratch.annotator_wrapup_evaluation.scripts.check_court_votes \
  --prepared-root "$PREPARED"

python -m scratch.annotator_wrapup_evaluation.scripts.replay_player_sample \
  --prepared-root "$PREPARED" \
  --saved-root "$SAVED_PREDICTIONS"
```

The controlled 16-window sample uses seed `20260906`. It deliberately over-samples failures and should not be used to estimate a collection-wide false-rejection rate.

## Expanded summaries and heuristic comparison

```bash
python -m scratch.annotator_wrapup_evaluation.scripts.summarise_extended

python -m scratch.annotator_wrapup_evaluation.scripts.evaluate_heuristic \
  --annotations "$ANNOTATIONS" \
  --saved-root "$SAVED_PREDICTIONS" \
  --output scratch/annotator_wrapup_evaluation/results

python -m scratch.annotator_wrapup_evaluation.scripts.summarise_heuristic

python -m scratch.annotator_wrapup_evaluation.scripts.extract_views \
  --sample scratch/annotator_wrapup_evaluation/results/video15_followup_sample.csv.gz \
  --sources "$SOURCES" \
  --output scratch/annotator_wrapup_evaluation/raw/video15_followup

python -m scratch.annotator_wrapup_evaluation.scripts.plot_video15_checks
```

The heuristic scorer preserves the ordinary output's native player answers. It alternates each saved `fitted_first_all` over that rally's saved `filtered_by_rally` contacts and compares the resulting side with `striker_halves`. Raw candidates have no native per-event player answer, so they are scored for timing only. The scorer does not impose learned selection scores or learned player correction on the heuristic.

The one-video native smoke took 22.4 seconds. The full four-way recount took 444.3 seconds.

## Video exclusions and alignment review

```bash
python -m scratch.annotator_wrapup_evaluation.scripts.summarise_video_exclusions
python -m scratch.annotator_wrapup_evaluation.scripts.sample_alignment_checks

python -m scratch.annotator_wrapup_evaluation.scripts.extract_alignment_labels \
  --sample scratch/annotator_wrapup_evaluation/results/alignment_sample.csv.gz \
  --annotations "$ANNOTATIONS" \
  --output scratch/annotator_wrapup_evaluation/results/alignment_labels.csv.gz

python -m scratch.annotator_wrapup_evaluation.scripts.extract_views \
  --sample scratch/annotator_wrapup_evaluation/results/alignment_sample.csv.gz \
  --sources "$SOURCES" \
  --output scratch/annotator_wrapup_evaluation/raw/alignment_checks

python -m scratch.annotator_wrapup_evaluation.scripts.summarise_alignment_checks
python -m scratch.annotator_wrapup_evaluation.scripts.build_video_view
```

The 53-window sample uses seed `20260907`.

The saved branch review records game/score observations. The later direct hit/player judgements are discussed separately below because they were published in issue #147 rather than folded into these branch result tables.

## Court issue replay

Video 53 court corners:

```bash
python -m scratch.annotator_wrapup_evaluation.scripts.replay_court_corners \
  --prepared-root "$PREPARED" \
  --sources "$SOURCES" \
  --output scratch/annotator_wrapup_evaluation/results/video53_nn_replay.json.gz

python -m scratch.annotator_wrapup_evaluation.scripts.plot_court_issue
```

`replay_court_corners.py` checks the court-model weights against the saved receipt. The replayed OpenCV fallback matches the saved fallback within 0.02 pixels in the published check.

Plotting uses saved replay data and previously extracted source frames. Neither command changes detector predictions.

## Per-video viewer

The canonical repository can rebuild the standalone viewer with:

```bash
python -m scratch.annotator_wrapup_evaluation.scripts.build_video_view
```

The generated `VIDEO_BREAKDOWN.html` embeds its data and does not need a network connection. It shows the 47 videos under the two saved output methods using cleaned labels and ±10 frames.

Open [VIDEO_BREAKDOWN.html](VIDEO_BREAKDOWN.html) locally. It includes labelled far/near player against predicted far/near, missing-player and missing-hit outcomes. Unmatched predictions are separate. It also shows contact, serve and whole-rally scores, court/player availability, and correct, wrong and unjudgeable selected clips.

## Validation already completed

The branch records these checks as successful:

- one-video smoke followed by complete 47-video baseline recount;
- both label populations and both timing allowances reproduce saved summaries;
- complete context extraction;
- all 162,754 population/tolerance contact rows join to frame context;
- all 14,774 rally identities join the learned-output tables;
- source-video frame/fps checks on the visual requests;
- exact original people-vote arrays in all eight diagnostic scenes;
- both current-frame player-validity fields match all 91,970 saved video-17 feature rows in the sequential replay;
- native filtering lists, player parity, frame bounds and counts pass for all 47 heuristic videos;
- all 53 source-row checks and frame extractions pass;
- all 94 viewer video/method choices pass matrix-sum and JavaScript rendering checks;
- scoped Ruff and Python syntax checks pass;
- compressed result tables parse successfully and local Markdown links were checked in the branch work;
- Serena/Pyrefly reports no diagnostics for the evaluation scripts.

The production code was unchanged, so the wrap-up did not use a whole-project test run as evidence of the observational results.

## Summary figures

From the directory containing these reports, run:

```bash
python figures/generate_published_figures.py
```

The script reads `results/exclusion_metrics.csv.gz` in the enclosing evaluation directory and writes the five summary PNGs beside itself. It uses cleaned labels at ±10 frames for both methods and all three video populations.

## Later direct hit judgements

The 24 direct checks are recorded locally under `scratch/annotator_wrapup_evaluation/worklog/`:

- `CONTACT_CASES.md` links each judgement to its frames and clip.
- `contact_judgements.json` stores the judgements and estimated hit intervals.
- `FOLLOWUP_RESULTS.md` explains the findings and how the footage was checked.

[Issue #147](https://github.com/ahalp90/badminton_cv_annotator/issues/147) also publishes the findings. These human judgements leave the saved detector scores unchanged. Rerunning the scoreboard summaries does not recreate the direct checks.

The local worklog is Git-ignored. Retain it with the saved evidence; a clean checkout of the published commit does not contain it.

## Original-ShuttleSet recount

The recount scores saved final predictions on 32 development videos. It applies the existing fixed-membership boundary padding and runs no training or vision models. Tolerances below use a 30 fps clock and scale with the source frame rate.

| Final learned output | ±10 frames | ±5 frames |
|---|---:|---:|
| Whole rally interval inside a clip | 2,113 / 2,691 | 2,113 / 2,691 |
| Exact whole-rally contact sequence | 1,230 / 2,691 | 972 / 2,691 |
| Fully correct rally, including players | 1,209 / 2,691 | 958 / 2,691 |
| Contact timing match | 24,952 / 27,571 | 24,373 / 27,571 |
| Contact timing + correct player | 24,285 / 27,571 | 23,766 / 27,571 |
| Serve timing match | 1,894 / 2,691 | 1,565 / 2,691 |
| Serve timing + correct player | 1,790 / 2,691 | 1,487 / 2,691 |

The containing clip may span more than one rally. Exact-sequence and fully correct results require one complete rally with no missing or extra contacts.

Under `scratch/annotator_wrapup_evaluation/worklog/`, `original_development/score_original_development.json.gz` holds the totals. Its companion `score_original_development_per_video.csv.gz` holds the per-video results. `FOLLOWUP_RESULTS.md` includes the comparison chart and the inputs needed for the remaining eight videos: 18, 22, 24, 25, 30, 31, 39 and 40.

Run from the repository root, choosing a fresh output directory:

```bash
PYTHONPATH="$PWD/src:$PWD" ~/.venvs/badminton-cicd/bin/python \
  -m scratch.annotator_wrapup_evaluation.worklog.score_original_development \
  --output /tmp/annotator-original32-recount
```

Add `--limit 1` for a one-video smoke check. The completed recount reproduced the saved 1,209 and 958 fully correct rallies; all 64 per-video rows summed to the totals.

## Completed detector experiments

The rejected closing-pass experiments are documented in [last_followups.md](last_followups.md). Their original reproduction commands require the predecessor caches and should be run to a fresh output directory:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH="$PWD/src:$PWD"
followup_run=/path/to/fresh/contact-followup

python -m scratch.contact_det_closing_pass.scripts.replay_edge_padding \
  --annotations /path/to/shuttleset22/annotations \
  --output "$followup_run/edge_padding.json.gz"

python -m scratch.contact_det_closing_pass.scripts.run_padded_target_census \
  --output-root "$followup_run/targets" --jobs 16

python -m scratch.contact_det_closing_pass.scripts.run_padded_target_fit \
  --census "$followup_run/targets" \
  --output-root "$followup_run/fit" --jobs 4

python -m scratch.contact_det_closing_pass.scripts.run_insertion_broader \
  --variant local \
  --models "$followup_run/fit/models.joblib" \
  --output-root "$followup_run/broader" \
  --score-root "$followup_run/scores" --jobs 4

python -m scratch.contact_det_closing_pass.scripts.score_padded_chooser \
  --predictions "$followup_run/broader/local_broader_predictions.json.gz" \
  --annotations /path/to/shuttleset22/annotations \
  --output "$followup_run/broader/padded_comparison.json.gz"

python -m scratch.contact_det_closing_pass.scripts.count_selected_repairs \
  --output-root "$followup_run/selected_repairs" --jobs 16
```

The target census accepts `--limit-fixtures 1` for a one-video smoke. The selected-repair census accepts `--limit-videos 1`. The completed runs and focused tests exited successfully; the predecessor report also records scoped Ruff success. A whole-project Pyrefly run returned 11 missing-import errors in unchanged tests, helper scripts and optional video-language-model dependencies, so that failure was not used as evidence against the self-contained experiments.
