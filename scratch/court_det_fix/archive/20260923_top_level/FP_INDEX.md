# Find court-detector files by idea

This maps ideas to their files. Start with your question, then follow one route.
Most dated folders are frozen
experiments, not successive versions of a deployable detector.

`GX` names views from the difficult amateur video. `Am1`–`Am4` name other
amateur videos; `SS03` and `SS21` identify ShuttleSet videos. A candidate such
as `G1:16:44` is source-qualified within a case. It is not globally unique.
**Saved W5** selects from the full pool; **Saved G1/templates** restricts the
same saved ranking by source membership. They are not before/after colour arms:
50/64 available fits have identical geometry. **Reference-best** chooses a fit
retrospectively using annotations and is not a detector selection.
`/child` denotes a separately refined candidate; do not transfer a ruling
between a parent and child without checking their geometry.

## Code, inputs and big working packets

| Subtree | Its job |
| --- | --- |
| [w5_holistic/](../../w5_holistic) | Whole-court experiment runner, measurements, refinement and galleries; not the integrated detector |
| [wider_evaluation/](../../wider_evaluation) | Preserved 71-view manifest, numeric fits and full-versus-G1/template comparison; source of the colour diagnostic's saved courts |
| [svd_runtime/](../../svd_runtime/README.md) | SVD integration, retention links, completed matcher benchmark and optional compute audit |
| [svd_search/](../../svd_search/WORKLOG.md) | Three-arm six-case experiment, all 18 result records, receipts and the shared gallery template |
| [colour_consistency/](../../colour_consistency/PLAN.md) | Fixed-geometry diagnostic, completed automatic floor/paint decision trials, automatic edge comparison and galleries; no adopted colour veto |
| [line_identity/](../../line_identity) | Automatic line-matching proposal experiments; `line_run_matcher.py` is the line-identity matcher |
| [direction_agreement/](../../direction_agreement) | Fixed direction experiments and their E0–E4 records |
| [frozen_helpers_20260914/](../../frozen_helpers_20260914) | Fixed helper code used to reproduce older experiments |
| [frozen_views/](../../frozen_views/README.md) | Shared saved frames, controls and input packs; start here for the actual input pixels |
| [evidence/](../../evidence) | Findings grouped by idea, with retained tables, scripts and selected artefacts |
| [next_steps_20260916/](../../next_steps_20260916) | Historical L1/L2/L3 and C2 experiments, despite the name; not the current task list |
| `worklog/remote_records_20260921/` (local-only) | Owner of the large preserved G0/G1 inputs and populations; start with its `README.md` |
| [experiments/annotator/independent_court/](../../../../experiments/annotator/independent_court/README.md) | Older reusable implementations and compressed recorded experiments outside this scratch subtree |

Some working packets are intentionally too large for Git. The
[GitHub review packet](../../evidence/review_20260922/README.md) states exactly what
is published and what remains local. A local path in an old run record is not
a promise that GitHub contains that file. GitHub does not render the old HTML
atlases as applications; use their linked images or the Markdown review pages.

Recovery archives are for retrieving superseded material, not normal reading.
Their route remains in [INDEX.md](../../INDEX.md#recovery).
