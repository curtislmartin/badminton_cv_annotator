# W5 steering record

Change record for the holistic court-detector pilot. Each entry says what changed, which
observation motivated it, and what happened to the known controls. Numbers are rank-1
corner error against the approved supplied control, in native pixels, read only after the
automatic rankings were saved.

## Pilot outcome (run `w5_stage2_20260920`, initial provisional reduction)

Visual rulings are in `runs/w5_stage2_20260920/visual_rulings.json`.

| view | legacy baseline | original candidates | original + adjusted candidates | failure class |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GX0 | usable | wrong_court | usable | original-candidate ranking failed on camera plausibility |
| Am2-150 | usable | needs_correction | needs_correction | misranked, shifted alias; paint spread clue |
| Am2-28019 | usable | wrong_court | wrong_court | misranked, camera clue |
| Am3-0 | usable | wrong_court | wrong_court | misranked, camera clue |
| SS03-19 | usable | usable | usable | none |

Every view had a usable court in the bounded parent population, so admission is not the
problem. All four bad rows are ranking failures. Best usable parent per view: GX0 22:4588
(15 px), Am2-150 30:137 (13 px), Am2-28019 15:0 (15 px), Am3-0 43:22605 (8.5 px), SS03-19
1:1278 (3 px).

What the false winners share:

- camera error 0.33 to 2.9, where every usable court sits at or below 0.064;
- large parts of the court outside the frame, so a few tiny spans (65 to 92 px) carry the
  paint readout while whole markings at zero support hide behind the per-marking mean.

Am2-150 is different. The winner among original candidates has camera error 0.043 and is
the right court family, shifted sideways. Camera plausibility cannot separate it; the
paint evidence must.

Refit: children improved every good parent on GX0, Am2-150, Am2-28019 and SS03-19. On
Am3-0 children damaged 14 of 49 parents within 25 px and improved 4. Refit is kept for
diagnosis and is not revised in this round.

## Audit rulings on seance 1

A contract audit of the seance-1 code found one bug and several hygiene gaps.

- Junction-direction bug: `verifier.raw_junctions` passed the court-space arm direction to the image-space
  support and photometry tests. On the perspective views (all pilot views except SS03-19)
  the raw arm support, arm ridge contrast and contradiction records did not measure the
  arms. Junction evidence feeds no ranking, so the three comparison selections stand. Fix: derive the
  direction from the projected samples, as `junction_observations.measure` does.
- Replay: `reconstruct_generation_entries` passed native corners to `select_pool`, where
  L2 divides by the native/working scale first. Replaying both ways gave identical 256-ID
  orders on the three replayed pilot views. Conform to L2 anyway.
- `sync.sh` pushed the frozen G0 records and baseline generation onto the host with
  `rsync --delete`. Frozen host inputs are compared, never overwritten.
- The legacy baseline ranks the G0 union half by its S0 stripe scores and the G1 half by S1 scores,
  where L2's union cells rescored both under one observation set. Ruling: keep. The
  contract asks the legacy baseline to preserve each source's filtered-observation replay, and the
  mix only touches the stripe tie-break behind `profile.score`.
- `evidence_sparse` fallbacks from contract section 13 were not implemented. Not triggered
  in the pilot; implement.
- `has_same_image_boxes` decides by case-name prefix. Derive it from the record.

## Rule revisions for seance 2

### Reject implausible camera geometry

Change: a parent or child is eligible for the automatic ranking only when its saved
`camera_error` is present and at most 0.1. Ineligible candidates keep their full evidence
record and stay in the diagnostic lists. When no hard-valid candidate passes, the view
returns `no_plausible_camera` with no selection and the ungated order saved.

Motivation: the camera-clue failure class above. Sensitivity from the saved pilot evidence,
rank-1 control error under the pilot reduction gated at each limit, parents then
parents+children:

| limit | GX0 | Am2-150 | Am2-28019 | Am3-0 | SS03-19 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.03 | 33 / 11 | 25 / 18 | 37 / 18 | 24 / 19 | 4 / 3 |
| 0.05 | 33 / 11 | 17 / 18 | 37 / 18 | 24 / 19 | 4 / 3 |
| 0.1 | 33 / 11 | 17 / 39 | 37 / 18 | 24 / 19 | 4 / 3 |
| 0.2 | 33 / 11 | 17 / 39 | 37 / 18 | 24 / 19 | 4 / 3 |
| 0.3 | 33 / 11 | 17 / 39 | 1923 / 18 | 466 / 502 | 4 / 3 |
| 0.5 | 33 / 11 | 17 / 39 | 511636 / 6562 | 579 / 579 | 4 / 3 |
| none | 838 / 11 | 17 / 39 | 511636 / 6562 | 579 / 579 | 4 / 3 |

The winners are flat from 0.03 to 0.2 and collapse between 0.3 and 0.5. The historical
value 0.1 sits in the flat region and was not tuned on these views.

Tension with the W5 operating assumption: this turns an inherited cutoff back into a hard
eligibility test. It is kept hard, with an explicit status, because a soft penalty would
need a new scale parameter with no better provenance. The negative control SS03-19
165:6702 has camera error 0.069 and passes this filter, so the paint reduction, not the filter, must
keep it below the positive control 1:60. Watch that row.

### Weight paint evidence by visible line length

Change: each direction's mean of the per-marking paint-backed readout `q_paint10` (and of
`q_geom` for the fallback) is weighted by that marking's projected visible span in pixels.
Markings with no readout or zero span drop out of their direction. `Q` stays the minimum
over the two directions and still needs both directions non-empty.

Motivation: the plain mean lets a 65 px stub count as much as a 900 px sideline, so a court
that is mostly out of frame can be carried by a few stubs. Am2-150 shows the same problem
inside the plausible-camera set: the shifted alias wins on stubs while the true court's
long markings are better explained.

Effect from the saved evidence, rank-1 control error, parents then parents+children:

| reduction | GX0 | Am2-150 | Am2-28019 | Am3-0 | SS03-19 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| pilot rule | 838 / 11 | 17 / 39 | 511636 / 6562 | 579 / 579 | 4 / 3 |
| camera filter only | 33 / 11 | 17 / 39 | 37 / 18 | 24 / 19 | 4 / 3 |
| camera filter + visible-span weighting | 33 / 11 | 17 / 8 | 37 / 18 | 19 / 19 | 4 / 3 |
| visible-span weighting without camera filter | 720 / 11 | 17 / 8 | 320 / 326 | 19 / 19 | 4 / 3 |

Visible-span weighting does not replace the camera filter: GX0 and Am2-28019 still pick
implausible cameras without it. The camera filter alone leaves the Am2-150 adjusted
candidate ranking wrong. Together they answer both named failures. The final result ranks
original and locally adjusted candidates together.

Expected rulings after both changes, to be confirmed visually: GX0 usable, Am2-150 usable,
Am2-28019 usable or needs_correction (18 px native on a scale-2 view), Am3-0 usable or
needs_correction (19 px), SS03-19 usable.

### Contrast sensitivity after both scoring changes

The paint-backed readout uses the historical contrast probe of 10. Seance 2 reranks after
the camera filter and visible-span weighting with the probe at 5, 10, 15 and 20. It uses
the saved raw ridge arrays and reports the top candidate per view. The probe stays at 10
unless that table shows a reversal.

## Final close-out (run `w5_stage5_20260920`)

W5 closes with the final original-plus-adjusted ranking usable on eight of nine stress
views. GX5 is the only failed view. Its legacy, original-only and
original-plus-adjusted winners all follow rear court or hall structure instead of the
foreground court. No visual call needs human escalation.

| view | legacy selection / ruling | original-only selection / ruling | original-plus-adjusted selection / ruling | final failure |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GX0 | `G0:22:4588` / usable | `G1:22:270` / usable | `G0:22:4580/child` / usable | — |
| GX5 | `G0:181:973` / wrong_court | `G0:181:996` / wrong_court | `G0:181:948/child` / wrong_court | missing |
| Am2-150 | `G0:30:33` / usable | `G0:30:148` / usable | `G1:30:137/child` / usable | — |
| Am2-28019 | `G1:15:168` / usable | `G1:15:3024` / needs_correction | `G1:15:164/child` / usable | — |
| Am3-0 | `G1:43:296` / usable | `G1:43:299` / usable | `G1:43:299/child` / usable | — |
| SS03-17 | `G1:1:71` / usable | `G1:1:5355` / usable | `G1:1:1308/child` / usable | — |
| SS03-19 | `G0:1:60` / usable | `G0:1:74` / usable | `G1:1:533/child` / usable | — |
| SS03-16 | `G0:1:31` / usable | `G0:1:31` / usable | `G0:1:31` / usable | — |
| SS21-20 | `G1:0:2` / usable | `G1:0:1970` / usable | `G1:0:1970` / usable | — |

### Collision ruling

The collision work changed identity and provenance handling, not a scientific conclusion.
The final packet contains 4,608 source occurrences, 268 exact cross-source duplicate
groups, 4,340 canonical parents and 3,667 valid children. Every duplicate group contains
one G0 and one G1 occurrence with matching W5 gates.

GX0, Am3 and GX5 keep the same common-candidate evidence and selections as the earlier
packets. Am2-150 removes one exact duplicate parent and its child. Its shared-candidate
evidence and all three selected geometries stay unchanged. Two diagnostic ranks move because
the duplicate entries above them disappeared. The collision repair also lets the five
previously stopped views complete. These changes do not reverse any W5 finding.

### Remaining blocker and next experiment

The remaining blocker is **proposal**. GX5 has no usable foreground court in the bounded
population, including the saved material from before global retention. Ranking cannot
select geometry that was never proposed. Admission and refit are therefore downstream of
the failure. The earlier GX5 source audit in
[`automatic_axes_results.md`](../../../experiments/annotator/independent_court/recorded/player_guided/projective_patterns/automatic_axes_results.md)
found that the closest camera-eligible candidate was still 89.94 working pixels from the
control. It also found that the useful observed directions were lost during proposal.

Next, add the existing independent 2D line/template search as one bounded candidate
source. Use cached lines and broad families. Feed the resulting candidates through the
unchanged W5 evidence pass, camera filter and visible-span weighting. Run the same nine
views as regression cases. Only revisit line extraction if the cached fragments cannot
represent the required paint.

Do not run another W5 recompute before adding that candidate source. Keep the unused-scene
check and guarded reuse/shadow integration for later; neither answers the current failure
to generate the foreground-court candidate.

## Line-template candidate-source regression (run `line_template_regression_20260920`)

The added line-template source generates the missing GX5 foreground court. The final
original-plus-adjusted selection is now usable on GX5. The same source outranks usable
existing candidates with wrong courts on GX0 and Am2-28019. Direct pooling therefore
drops the final result from eight usable views to seven of nine.

| view | stage-5 final | line-template run final | ruling | old final's new rank |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| GX0 | `G0:22:4580/child` | `line_template:rectangle_19114:template_134/child` | wrong_court | 4 |
| GX5 | `G0:181:948/child` | `line_template:rectangle_85795:template_72/child` | usable | 40 |
| Am2-28019 | `G1:15:164/child` | `line_template:rectangle_210761:template_48` | wrong_court | 2 |

The other six final selections stay usable. Preflight and full-run source settings,
ordering, counts, contamination checks and proposal totals match on all nine views;
elapsed times differ. The stage-5 selections keep identical corners, homographies, gates
and ranking evidence. The legacy selections are also identical. This confirms again that
the collision repair changed identity and provenance handling, not a scientific
conclusion.

### Remaining blocker and next experiment

The remaining blocker is **admission**. GX0 and Am2-28019 both retain usable candidates
near the top of the final order, so the immediate symptom is misranking. The wrong
line-template candidates entered the pool with support measured from too little of the
court: 3 and 2 visible markings per direction on GX0, and 3 and 6 on Am2-28019. The
correct new GX5 candidate has 6 and 6. This is a source-admission weakness before it is a
general ranking problem. The line-template source has solved the GX5 proposal failure,
and refit does not explain either regression.

Filtering the saved final order so line-template parents and children need at least four
visible markings in each direction selects the visually usable court on all nine
development views. Thresholds 4, 5 and 6 give the same nine winners; threshold 3 still
fails Am2-28019. This uses source visibility only and leaves the final score order intact.
The result is in
`runs/line_template_regression_20260920/line_visibility_sensitivity.json`.

Run one bounded follow-up on the line-template admission floor. Test thresholds 3 through
6 before the 256-candidate cap, refill the pool, and rerun the nine views plus unused
scenes. Keep proposal generation, refit and the final paint score fixed. The saved-pool
check is post-hoc and cannot show which later hypotheses will refill the pool.

The separate player-coverage diagnostic also selects the usable court on all nine saved
pools. Keep it as a secondary comparison. It was chosen after the visual rulings and it
couples court detection to player tracking, while the source-visibility rule addresses the
same failures directly.

## Directional admission sweep: decision rule

Compare `(0,0)`, `(3,3)`, `(4,3)` and `(5,3)` under identical proposal, refit and scoring
settings over the exact nine original regression cases plus 18 added scenes. An arm is safe
only if it leaves a usable final selection on every original case, rejects the known weak
admissions on GX0 and Am2-28019, and retains the useful GX5 admission.

Visually review every changed winner across all 18 added scenes using the four-arm contact
sheets. Among safe arms, choose the least restrictive visibility floor. If `(4,3)` and
`(5,3)` are otherwise tied, choose `(4,3)`. Any unexplained regression rejects the arm; it
must not prompt a patch or a case-specific exception. Record the selected arm, changed
winners and visual rulings in the comparison packet.

This decision selects an admission rule; it does not approve integration. Before
integration, benchmark the production-only path on ordinary hardware with
player detections supplied. HPC time spent comparing arms is development cost
and must not be reported as deployed inference speed. The cache design speeds
future comparisons but does not reduce the cost of building one hypothesis bank.
