# Findings and decisions

G1 paint-filtered proposals, line templates and player evidence remain a
candidate smaller design. The completed wider run loses a tolerable Am4-319
fit when G0 is removed, so retain full-source access while investigating that
regression. Reliable fitting and safe automatic acceptance remain unresolved.
CourtKeyNet repair is retired; removing its dependencies remains unfinished.

The nine-view stress panel and expanded 27-case corpus are development data,
not representative held-out evaluations. A nearby reference fit, a generated
candidate, an automatic winner and a visually usable court are different
outcomes. Keep those distinctions when interpreting every result below.

| ID | Finding and decision | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| D01 | The old chain passed 0/11 labelled amateur frames. Broadcast repair lessons survive, but CourtKeyNet is excluded from the replacement design. | [Retirement](../../evidence/retirement/README.md) |
| D02 | Better line evidence and useful candidate pools did not solve court identity. Preserve earlier inputs, proposal records and contrary examples; do not revive failed acceptance rules. | [Independent proposals](../../evidence/independent_proposals/README.md) |
| D03 | Midpoint and representative changes each caused regressions. Fixed-membership SVD is diagnostic, not a tested matcher improvement. SVD search reduction remains a deployment lead; graph search should follow a settled search design. Neither speedup has been measured. | [Direction search](../../evidence/direction_search/README.md) |
| D04 | Score ordering and the 512-assignment cap discard court-compatible matches on traced pairs. A broader fixed-budget rule helped one case and badly regressed another. Screen all pairs before another expensive trial. | [Exact traces and stopped probe](../../evidence/direction_search/README.md#cap-and-duplicate-corrections) |
| D05 | The expanded crossed comparison supports G1 proposal access, but not universally better S1 ranking. G0 retains some complementary coverage. Adding candidates can worsen selection. | [G0/G1](../../evidence/g0_g1/README.md) |
| D06 | W5 `(4,3)` and `(5,3)` select identical courts, with 21/27 usable development selections. The existing player gate raises this to 24/27. G1 plus templates preserves that count and the same failures. Test this smaller design; no tested floor is a sufficient acceptance rule. | [Evaluation](evaluation_results_20260922.md) |
| D07 | All five corrected person-mask matcher comparisons are complete. Useful broadcast proposals survive, including SS03-17 despite its poor paint winner. Masks alone do not rescue GX5. Historical direction-changing masked arms remain qualified. | [Provenance and repairs](../../evidence/holistic_admission/box_provenance.md) |
| D08 | On the same registered GX union, per-frame and shared paint ranking identify the played court on 7/7 frames, versus 5/7 with native-only access. Far-end errors remain; these are not precise-fit counts. Shared line ranking selects a wall on all seven. Prioritise stable-view proposal reuse and measure far-marking accuracy. | [Pixel and temporal evidence](../../evidence/pixel_temporal/README.md) |
| D09 | The wider comparison completes 47 frozen cases and 24 controls. Removing G0 loses the tolerable Am4-319 fit. Both arms accept one of eight labelled non-court controls. Static-grid residuals show inward width bias; SS03-34 has a confirmed inner/outer paint-edge misinterpretation. | [Wider results and checks](wider_evaluation_20260922.md#completed-numeric-comparison) |
| D10 | A fixed-point polarity check partly corrects the left inset. Across six video-03 scenes, median left-edge disagreement with the shared static grid falls from 3.745 to 1.799 working pixels. Scores are mixed; the approved GX control moves under 0.05 pixels. Inspect remaining residuals before integrating a new assignment rule. | [Seven-case polarity test](../../edge_polarity/README.md) |

## What counts as good enough

The recorded 24/27 W5 result means qualitatively usable **for development**.
It is not a count of clean fits. The GX temporal result of 7/7 means that paint
ranking identifies the played court; it does not mean seven accurate fits.
Do not silently relabel either historical count under a stricter standard.

Use three separate judgements in the next visual review:

- **Clean fit:** visible boundaries and service markings follow the court
- **Tolerable fallback:** the right court has a limited, visible error that
  could be accepted on a rare difficult case; record the affected region
- **Unacceptable fit:** wrong court or substantial missing/extra court area;
  also record any exceptional last-resort use separately

User review places frame-0 G1 `143:158` in the fallback category: it is skewed
and clips a sliver of the far-left court. GX86088 G1 `16:44` is a more serious
last resort. Its close near-end alignment hides loss of nearly the whole far
long-service-to-baseline strip. An error of that size at any reasonable
frequency would block shipping. These are the temporal candidates, not an
automatic ruling on their separately refined W5 children.

Review far-end crops alongside full images. Record far-baseline, long-service
and sideline errors separately from near-end error. Where annotations permit,
measure missing court area as well as landmark distance. Report error severity
and frequency, not one pooled “usable” rate. The user clarified the standard on
22 September: imperceptible misalignment is the visual ideal. Following the
outer edges of the white markings is preferred, not a minimum deployment
threshold. Numerical errors support the visual review; this comparison sets no
new pixel cutoff or acceptable fallback frequency. Borderline fits need user
review.

## Older ideas worth bringing back

Bring mechanisms back one at a time against the frozen baseline. The wider
sample test below comes first; its failures should decide which lead gets
the next bounded experiment.

| Priority | Lead and why it is promising | What is missing or unsafe |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core design | **Sparse multi-frame agreement and stable-view proposal reuse.** Decide a scene's court from several sampled frames, with shared proposals and supporting observations. The complete GX comparison identifies the played court on 7/7 frames with the common pool, versus 5/7 with each frame's own pool. | This is an access gain, not accurate fitting or a camera-change detector. Check camera stability and support in each sampled image. The failed shared line median rules out that selector, not the need for multi-frame agreement. |
| Next, especially for yellow courts | **Net-image evidence plus pooled-fragment refinement.** The older three-frame Yellow replay changed worst-corner error from 221.19 px with floor scoring to 26.01 with net evidence, then 21.22 after pooled refinement. W5 has same-view refinement but not this combined temporal method. | These are 1280×720 errors against old references, not the current working-pixel metric. Letterboxed worsened from 10.06 to 14.75; the net cue and refinement were not isolated temporal ablations. Player-pair identity and camera stability remain prerequisites. |
| Next, for correct-court but poor-fit cases | **Constrained stripe/marking refinement, with explicit far-end assessment.** Older fixed-assignment refits sometimes improved a plausible start. Keep parents beside children and inspect both near and far markings. | W5 already has same-view fixed-assignment refinement, so simply adding a refit is not a new mechanism. Across 357 old parent/refit pairs, an improvement rule chose 35 harmful refits. A lower fitting objective does not certify better court geometry. |
| Alongside reuse | **Scene-repair safeguards without CourtKeyNet.** Borrowed geometry should agree with the target's own visible lines. Keep inferred repairs from becoming donors. Separate mixed broadcast composites from ordinary views. | Those safeguards came from broadcast repair; they do not validate amateur detection. Camera novelty, colour and temporal consistency alone cannot certify a court. |
| Early speed experiment | **SVD-based search reduction.** Fit compact direction/subspace representations and test whether redundant hypotheses can be removed before expensive matching. The objective is much less search without losing useful courts, not merely a smaller fit residual. | The saved fixed-group SVD diagnostics do not establish search reduction or retained coverage. Compare hypothesis counts, matcher work, runtime and candidate/winner quality. Avoid merging distinct court-supported alternatives just because their directions are close. |
| Conditional on a traced coverage failure | **Better retention before candidate caps.** Exact traces show useful assignments discarded before whole-court scoring sees them. | The tested diversity rule helped one pair and harmed another. Screen all pairs and regression controls before changing the 512-assignment cap; this is distinct from W5's 256-template retention limit. |
| After the search rules settle | **Graph search / shared partial states.** Reuse equivalent partial assignments rather than revisiting the same work along many search paths. | This is a speed/implementation lead, not a new accuracy result. Define state equivalence from the final matcher constraints and verify equivalent outputs before adopting it. Its complexity makes it a later step. |

The [older temporal replay account](../../../../experiments/annotator/independent_court/recorded/player_guided/projective_patterns/evaluation/temporal_assessment.md#an-earlier-shared-court-experiment-already-exists)
includes the Yellow/Letterboxed/Centre comparisons and links the saved code.
That replay uses footpoints and raw fragments; the historical spatial-mask
error does not invalidate it. Its net cue measures image support along
projected net segments. The newer W5 projected-post diagnostic only records
geometry, so it is not a test of that image cue.

See [refit evidence](../../evidence/independent_proposals/README.md#other-branches-and-why-their-records-remain-useful),
[donor safeguards](../../evidence/retirement/README.md#non-model-lessons-worth-keeping)
and [cap traces](../../evidence/direction_search/README.md#cap-and-duplicate-corrections).
Keep global midpoint/direction replacements, connected-pixel vetoes and
junction-first ranking out of the main design for now. Do not equate the old
fixed-group SVD diagnostic with the proposed search-reduction experiment.
Retain player
evidence, but compare rejection/fallback behaviour rather than assuming a
hard gate is always preferable to a ranking feature.

### Scene-level operation is the target

Sample several frames from a scene or verified stable camera view. Share
proposal search and aggregate compatible line, paint and player observations
across those samples. Require multi-frame support before assigning the court
to the scene, then reuse it with cheap checks for camera change or loss of
support. A failed check should trigger resampling/recalibration or abstention.
Choose the sample count, spacing and agreement rule through the next tests.

The detector should neither decide a whole scene from one frame nor repeat
full independent search on every frame. Agreement must include visible court
geometry, especially at the far end; a wall can score consistently across
frames. The existing fixed-pool replay tests only part of this design. It does
not yet implement multi-frame generation, a scene sampler or change handling.

## Next design and wider test

The wider fixed-view test is complete; its [results](wider_evaluation_20260922.md)
supersede the scheduling instructions below. The preserved protocol explains
its scope. The [returned WebUI follow-ups](../../evidence/webui_followups_20260922/README.md)
reproduce locally. Next trace the [earlier gallery fits](../../evidence/independent_proposals/history_audit_20260922.md)
through the later pipeline before choosing a fitting or ranking change.

First run the wider fixed-view comparison to expose coverage and fitting
failures. Then evaluate scene-level sampling and agreement on the source clips;
single-view success cannot pass that second requirement. Preserve this order
without treating the single-view runner as the deployment architecture.

Use the current full-source W5 `(4,3)` design as the baseline. Compare G1 plus
line templates under the same scoring and player rule. Where possible, derive
the source restriction from one shared measured pool rather than repeating
expensive image measurements. Preserve rejected candidates so a bad result
can be separated into missing proposals, poor ranking or an overstrict gate.

Completed pre-run protocol:

1. Freeze the input list, source/scoring settings and review categories. Mark
   prior use by view and video; unused frames from familiar videos are not a
   held-out generalisation test.
2. Smoke-test ordinary broadcast, difficult amateur and contaminated-view
   cases. Confirm input masks, candidate/source identity, saved raw frames and
   player-observation availability. Do not silently turn missing observations
   into a passed or failed player gate.
3. Remove measured unused diagnostics and repeated image conversion only with
   an equality check on the retained measurements. Use at most six workers
   for this research run; deployment timing is a later measurement.

Inspect all selected overlays, including failures and far-end crops. Separate
clean, fallback and unacceptable rates for broadcast and amateur views. Count
empty pools, rejected useful proposals and abstentions explicitly. Keep
contaminated broadcast medians visible in the results; do not silently drop
them from the denominator.

Record player-gate outcome separately from proposal and ranking outcome. Keep
both ungated and gated winners and the number of observed frames per case.
The current packs contain only three player samples per broadcast composite,
versus 29–31 per amateur case. The same fractional cutoff therefore uses
different amounts of evidence. All 47 cases have footpoint observations;
the 24 extra controls need their input/observation check before the run.

The broader committed set is an expansion of development coverage. A later
test on unseen cameras/videos is still needed before a deployment claim.

### Frozen sample coverage

The [three frozen input packs](../../frozen_views/README.md) contain 47 cases: 20
ShuttleSet composite views, seven GX frames and 20 other amateur frames.
The recent panel covered all seven GX frames, ten broadcast views and ten
other amateur frames. These **20 additional views** should enter the next run:

| Source | Outside the recent 27-case panel |
| --- | --- |
| ShuttleSet video 03 | scenes 0001, 0023, 0032, 0046 |
| ShuttleSet video 21 | scenes 0005, 0015, 0024, 0029, 0034, 0044 |
| Yellow clip | frames 90, 156 |
| Letterboxed clip | frames 58, 78 |
| Centre clip | frames 64, 71 |
| Am1 | frame 5352 |
| Am3 | frames 17174, 24515 |
| Am4 | frame 319 |

The 20 non-GX amateur frames cover the complete small annotated set: the
[original 11 frames](../../../../data/amateur_court_corners/README.md) and
[nine September additions](../../../../data/amateur_court_corners/2026-09-08/README.md).
Use their visible clicked landmarks to assess fit; extrapolated offscreen
corners measure agreement with an annotation model, not observed accuracy.
Am4's camera moves between sampled frames, so do not reuse a court across
that clip without checking the view.

The broadcast manifest marks SS21-10 and SS21-39 as `view_unverified`.
Keep their pipeline outcomes, but distinguish unreliable composite/reference
comparisons from normal-view geometry scores. The input packs are committed;
that does not imply that every raw image or source video is already in Git.

Also include the [24 recorded broadcast controls](../../../../experiments/annotator/independent_court/recorded/controls.json.gz)
as a separate rejection/review arm: eight are labelled non-court and 16 are
unlabelled. They are different raw frames from ShuttleSet video 21, not 24
new positive examples or independent cameras. Their raw PNGs are currently
local under `evidence/independent_proposals/development/inputs/controls/frames/`.
Check those inputs when freezing the run; unlabelled cases need human review,
not an assumed correct-court score. This makes 71 planned input cases:
47 frozen detector cases plus 24 controls, reported in separate groups.

The retired CourtKeyNet calibration's 400 court frames and 63 non-court
frames are a different historical study, not an additional reproducible
committed image set for this run.

## What remains before a detector can ship

Address the Am4-319 regression before removing G0. Yellow14 and Am1-54
need better proposal coverage. The user excludes unreliable edit-transition
views such as SS21-10 from required detection; confidence rejection is optional.
Retain player evidence while testing rejection and fallback on new
cameras. Remove unused junction diagnostics and repeated greyscale conversion
from the runtime path; the measured omission alone gave a 2.37× local speedup
without changing other evidence. This is not a deployment latency estimate.

Representative labelled evaluation, ordinary-hardware latency with player
detections supplied, camera-change handling and annotator integration remain
separate requirements. Development search time on Carmack is not deployment
latency. Remove CourtKeyNet and accidental model/weight-loading dependencies
before the branch finishes.
