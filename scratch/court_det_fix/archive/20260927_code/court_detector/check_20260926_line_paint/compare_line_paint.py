"""Compare the line-paint arm with the blend arm: picks, floor-metre errors, the good courts' places and time.

Errors are hand-mark errors in floor metres: each hand mark is mapped back onto the floor through the court,
and the error is how far it lands from where it should be. The keep rule, in README.md, uses each view's
largest error. The median error is shown too: a court slipped by a whole line can raise the largest error
only a little when the other court already has one bad mark.

Usage, from the repository root: compare_line_paint.py REPLAY_OUT UPRIGHT_RUN
  REPLAY_OUT: replay_line_paint.py's output, one folder per arm
  UPRIGHT_RUN: the upright check's run folder, for its views and saved W5 records
