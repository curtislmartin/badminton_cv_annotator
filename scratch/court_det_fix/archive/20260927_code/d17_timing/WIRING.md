# How the D17 court detector is wired

The accepted court detector (the D17 chain) runs end to end in two places:

- `run_d17.py` in this folder, a timing script. It is the baseline, and it
  hands data between stages through files and runtime swaps
- `court_detector/detect.py`, the same chain joined into one in-memory unit.
  `court_detector/run_views.py` runs it on the 28 test views and checks it
  against the baseline. `court_detector/STRIPPED.md` lists what it leaves out

This note says what `run_d17.py` calls, which runtime swaps change the chosen
court, and which inputs are frozen. It also says how the joined detector
replaces each swap and file. Read it before changing either, or before
optimising across stage boundaries.

Written against branch `exp/court-det-opt` at commit 44254b42, and updated
for the joined detector on 25 September 2026. Paths are relative to
`scratch/court_det_fix/` unless they start with `src/`, `tests/` or
`experiments/`.

## Terms

- **View**: one video frame to find a court in. The test set has 28, listed in
  `court_detector_optimisation_handover/claude_evidence/fresh_feet/run_feet_variants.sh`
- **Source record**: one view's input, a dict with the frame's size, its line
  fragments (`segments_px`, from DeepLSD), person boxes (`bbox_px`), player
  feet (`all_feet_px`), image path and provenance. All in native pixels
- **Context**: the `verifier.ViewContext` that `prepare_view` builds from a
  source record and its frame. It holds the working-size fragments, line
  families, grouped observations and the resized frame
- **G0, G1, line templates**: the three candidate sources. G0 searches all
  fragments. G1 searches only fragments that look like paint. Line templates
  build courts from rectangles of crossing lines
- **Parent, child**: a parent is a candidate court as proposed. Its child is
  the same court refitted to the painted stripes
- **W5**: the stage that measures every parent, refits it, and ranks parents
  and children together
- **Gated**: a candidate whose `historical.historical_fullcourt` flag is true,
  meaning it passed the full-court gates. Only gated candidates can be chosen
- **Runtime swap**: code that replaces a module's function while the program
  runs (monkey-patching). The chain depends on several

## Where the live code is

Several research folders hold modules with the same name, and the chain
imports them by bare name. `run_w5.add_helper_paths` sets the `sys.path`
order that decides which copy loads. Most of the live copies are in
`w5_holistic/` and `wider_evaluation/`. These are not:

- `run_automatic`, `run_given`, `projective_seed`, `run_population` and
  `inspect_appearance`: `next_steps_20260916/webui_seed/source/`
- `scan_population` and `run_diagnosis`: `frozen_helpers_20260914/marking_diagnosis/`
- `vp_pruning`: `frozen_helpers_20260914/vp_pruning/`
- `zone_net`: `frozen_helpers_20260914/legacy/`

`LIVE_MODULE_FILES` in `court_detector/detect.py` holds the full list.
`load_live_modules` checks every copy against it at start-up, and
`tests/test_court_detector_modules.py` checks the list against what
`run_d17.py`'s import order loads. The `experiments/` modules load by package
name, so only one copy exists.

## The chain at a glance

One call per stage, in the order `run_d17.main` makes them. The stripe refit
runs only when the net choice returns a court. Times are wall-clock seconds,
summed over the 28 one-view processes of the Carmack run for commit 44254b42
(`run_wall_s` total 8,250 s; the rest is imports, runtime loading and the
summary).

| Stage | Call | Takes | Produces | Disk | Time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| Load runtime | `wider_evaluation/run_cases.load_runtime(ROOT, control pack)` | Nothing per view | `run_w5`, the `verifier` module, a runtime dict; registers every case (see "Runtime swaps") | Reads the view packs | Start-up |
| Prepare view | `verifier.prepare_view(ROOT, case_id)` | Source record and frame | Context | Reads the pack and frame | 27 s |
| Search | `wider_evaluation/generation.ensure_populations(ROOT, context, runtime, arm_dir, 16)` | Context | G0 and G1 population records, up to 256 courts each | Writes an input audit and both records; the script reads them back | 5,319 s |
| W5 | `w5_holistic/run_w5.process_case(ROOT, case_id, arm_dir, min_visible_lengthwise=4, min_visible_cross_court=3)` | Fresh populations and seeded templates, both through swaps | Case record: `parents`, `valid_children`, `fit_attempts`, `rankings` | Writes the record and an arrays `.npz` | 2,754 s |
| Net choice | `run_d17.net_rows(...)`, then `net_recovery/bounded_trial.choose(rows, 0.04, 4.0)` | Case record, read back, and the context's fragments and size | The chosen court's `origin_key` or None, and the scored rows | Reads the record | 47 s |
| Stripe refit | `net_recovery/refit_selected.refit_selection(case_id, str(record_path), chosen, label, verifier, runtime, manifest)` | The chosen `origin_key`, the record path and the manifest | A dict; the court is its `corrected` entry | Reads the record and frame again | 48 s |

Selection happens before the stripe refit, as in the accepted 20-case gallery.
Keep that order.

### Search

- **Directions.** `vp_pruning.estimate` finds the view's line directions. Its
  settings come from `frozen_views/baseline_directions/gxBQ_window_00_frame_0.json.gz`;
  only that file's `settings` entry is read
- **G1 fragments.** `line_identity/filter_replay.paint_masks(source, native frame, scale)["paint"]`
  marks paint-like fragments, and `filtered_source` keeps them.
  `generation._filter_module` loads the module by file path, unless a module
  named `filter_replay` with both functions is already imported. Then it uses
  that one. The joined detector calls `court_detector/search.paint_mask` and
  `filtered_source` instead. `paint_mask` is the same code as the `"paint"`
  mask, and `filter_replay` imports its pieces back from `search`
- **Search per population.** `w5_holistic/automatic_generation.generate` runs
  once for G0 and once for G1. It tries each ordered pair of directions. It
  skips pairs outside the direction budget and pairs that fail the camera
  bound, then keeps 256 courts per pair and 256 overall. Budget 16 means every
  pair is eligible, which is the current baseline
- **Pool evidence.** `run_automatic.evaluate_pool` then measures up to 256
  kept courts: the gate evidence, plus legacy evidence (a stripe score and a
  paint profile per court, and the winner IDs). Only the legacy paint
  profiles re-read the frame. Nothing after the search reads the legacy
  evidence except the A ranking and the saved records. The joined detector
  passes `legacy_evidence=False` to `automatic_generation.generate`, which
  skips it

### W5 (`process_case`)

In order: load the runtime again, prepare the view again, load the three
populations, then call `score_populations`. That function checks the
populations for reference fields, merges duplicates
(`canonicalise_populations`), builds a record for every parent
(`make_parent_record`), and attempts a refit for each (`attempt_refit`). Only
hard-valid parents are measured and refitted; the rest are recorded as
invalid. Then it ranks. The ranking the detector uses is `rankings["C"]`,
over hard-valid parents and valid children together. The rest of
`process_case` is research: see "What a single detector keeps and drops".
The joined detector calls `score_populations` directly, with its checks
behind `self_checks`.

### Net choice

The helpers below now live in `court_detector/net_choice.py`.
`bounded_trial` and `am1_net_selection_trial` import them back.

`net_rows` walks `rankings["C"]["provisional_rank"]` and keeps gated
candidates only. For each, `project_pieces` projects the net. When that works
(state `measured`), `post_features` tests pieces 2 and 3, the two posts,
against the fragments.

`choose` scores each row as its evidence under `rankings["C"]["r2_criterion"]`,
plus 0.04 × the post reward. `net_rows` stores that evidence as
`paint_score`, but the criterion is not always paint. It is normally
`q_paint10_span_weighted`, and falls back to `q_geom_span_weighted` when no
camera-eligible candidate has a paint score (`verifier.rank_candidates`). A
post counts when a fragment covers one of its six lowest samples, and no
covering fragment reaches more than 4 working pixels below its base. The
reward is 0, 0.5 or 1 for zero, one or two posts. The first row in rank order
wins exact ties. No gated rows means no court: the view abstains.

`net_rows` copies how `bounded_trial.measure_case` builds rows. It leaves out
that function's checks against frozen results and the fields `choose` never
reads. `run_d17.py` and the joined detector both call it. Both also check
that weight 0 picks the top gated court.

### Stripe refit

`refit_selection` reads the case record from disk and prepares the view a
third time. It checks the frame's path and MD5 against
`wider_evaluation/runs/20260922/manifest.json.gz`. It then calls
`court_detector/stripe_refit.refit_chosen`, which holds the refit itself; the
joined detector calls `refit_chosen` directly. The helpers named below live
in `stripe_refit.py` too, and the research scripts import them back.

`refit_chosen` finds the chosen court's parent and saved fit attempt,
rebuilds the fit constraints (`fixed_stripe_refit.prepare`) and replays the
W5 fit. The replay must match the saved fit within 1e-4 native pixels. The
replay is a check only: `fitting.refine` builds new arrays, so skipping it
cannot change the corrected fit. The joined detector runs it only with
`self_checks` on.

Next it corrects which stripe edge each fit fragment sits on. For each fit
fragment:

- `relabel` measures masked grey profiles on either side of it, on the
  working frame
- `sample_fragment` samples colour along it on the native frame.
  `infer_polarity` turns that into a polarity, or 0 without 8 usable samples
  and an 80% majority
- `automatic_position` combines the old position, the grey contrast and pair
  count, the expected bright side and the polarity. It keeps the old
  position unless the polarity is known, there are at least 7 side pairs and
  the contrast is at least 10 grey levels

Only the constraint positions change. It then refits
(`fixed_stripe_refit.refine`), and `fit_geometry` validates the result.
The output's `corrected` entry holds `corners_native_px`,
`homography_working`, `valid` and `validity_reason`.

`fit_geometry` measures each fit through `describe`, which calls the
verifier's measurement. `run_d17.py` runs the refit outside
`prepared_measurements`, so the measurement finds real junctions. The joined
detector runs it inside, where junctions are a stub. The result is the same,
because `describe` keeps only `q_paint10_span_weighted` and
`q_geom_span_weighted`.

## Runtime swaps

These swaps and table changes carry the detector's behaviour or inputs. The
last column says what dropping each one does. The first three change the
chosen court with no error.

| Swap | Made in | Active | Without it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `run_w5.load_g0` and `load_g1` return the fresh populations | `run_d17.py` | For `process_case` | W5 scores old saved pools: `frozen_views/baseline_generation/` for G0, a 15 September remote record for G1 |
| `run_w5.import_runtime` adds `seeded_line_templates` as `runtime["line_template"]` | `run_d17.py` | Whenever W5 loads its runtime | Templates are built without the three seeds, which loses the Am1 recovery |
| `vp_pruning.estimate` adds three seed points: where each pair of the three longest lengthwise lines meets | `colour_consistency/am1_recovery_trial.generate_seeded` | Only while templates are built | No seeded templates. The search's own directions never see the seeds |
| `verifier.PACK_OF` and `verifier.CASE_LABELS` gain every case in the three packs and the control pack | `run_cases.load_runtime` | Always, in this script | 15 of the 28 views are missing from the verifier's own tables. Six pack views fail to load; the nine control views fail the label lookup |
| `verifier.load_source`, `load_case_provenance` and `frame_path` serve the control views | `run_cases.load_runtime` | Always, in this script | The 24 `sset_21_…` control views are not in the packs, so they fail |
| `verifier.load_source` replaces each view's `all_feet_px` from the `--feet` file | `run_d17.replace_feet` | With `--feet` | The pack's feet are used. The baseline uses the standing-only file |
| `run_automatic.frame_path` reads frames through `verifier.frame_path` | `generation.ensure_populations`, only during the search | Search | The search looks for frames in older folder layouts |
| `verifier.grayscale_sample` caches the greyscale frame; `verifier.raw_junctions` returns a stub | `wider_evaluation/measurement.prepared_measurements` | W5 | Same measurements, slower. Junctions reach only `candidate_review`, which is research |

The joined detector keeps only the `prepared_measurements` swap, around W5,
the net choice and the refit. It replaces the rest with arguments:

- Fresh populations go to `run_w5.score_populations` as arguments
- Seeded templates come from `line_template_source.generate(..., seed_points=...)`,
  with the seeds from `court_detector/search.seed_points`. The argument
  reaches the one `vp_pruning.estimate` call the swap changed
- The verifier's tables and loaders are not needed: the caller passes the
  source's pieces and the case provenance in `ViewInputs`, and
  `verifier.view_context` builds the context from them
- `court_detector/feet.py` builds the feet from the window detections
- The search gets the frame as an argument, and skips the legacy pool
  evidence, the only step that read the frame through `run_automatic.frame_path`

These swaps are timing only and change nothing:

- `generation.generate` is wrapped to label the G0 and G1 stages, and to apply
  the smoke-test option `--max-matched-pairs`
- About 50 `clock.wrap` calls time individual functions

### Traps

- **Swaps made after the runtime loads can miss.** `run_w5.load_verifier`
  copies the verifier's functions into `runtime["verifier"]` when the runtime
  loads. A later swap reaches only code that looks the function up on the
  module, or that loads the runtime again. Today that is harmless:
  `prepare_view` looks `load_source` up on the module, and `process_case`
  reloads the runtime. In a single detector, pass inputs in rather than
  swapping functions
- **The seeded templates must patch the modules W5 uses.** `run_d17.py`
  asserts that `am1_recovery_trial` holds the same `vp_pruning` and
  `line_template_source` modules. Which copy imports depends on
  `run_w5.add_helper_paths`; "Where the live code is" lists the live copies
- **One trial module is imported twice.** `run_d17.py` imports
  `am1_recovery_trial` by its bare name. `refit_selected.py` imports it as
  `scratch.court_det_fix.colour_consistency.am1_recovery_trial`, only for
  `resolve_saved_path`. Python treats these as two modules, and each runs its
  import-time code
- **Thread settings come first.** `run_d17.py` sets six thread variables
  (`OPENBLAS_`, `MKL_`, `OMP_`, `NUMEXPR_`, `VECLIB_MAXIMUM_` and
  `BLIS_NUM_THREADS`) to 1 before numpy and OpenCV load. It then calls
  `cv2.setNumThreads(1)`. Keep the same set-up for a bit-for-bit comparison
- **Imports have side effects.** `am1_recovery_trial`, `bounded_trial`,
  `refit_selected` and `edge_polarity/run_probe` edit `sys.path` when
  imported. `am1_recovery_trial` also sets three of the thread variables
  again. These research modules load others by bare name as they import:
  - `filter_replay`: eight, including `vp_pruning`, `projective_seed` and
    `run_population`, which the chain also uses
  - `edge_auto_trial`: `edge_polarity.local_audit`
  - `bounded_trial`: `run_cases` and `am1_net_selection_trial`
  - `am1_net_selection_trial`: `compare`, `run_w5` and `verifier`

  `run_w5.import_runtime` imports `run_population` before `run_diagnosis` on
  purpose; its comment explains why. The joined detector imports none of the
  research modules above. It takes their helpers from the `court_detector/`
  modules, which load no research module by bare name and leave `sys.path`
  alone. `tests/test_court_detector_modules.py` checks both
- **Files change the values they carry.** The populations and the case
  record pass through JSON files, and the stages after them read what came
  back. JSON turns tuples into lists and numpy values into plain Python
  numbers, and the record is written with sorted keys and non-finite values as
  null. This matters: W5's duplicate merge compares values with
  `run_w5.values_equal_with_nan`, which only recurses into lists, and the
  refit reads its stripe assignments as float lists. The joined detector
  repeats both round trips in memory. Populations:
  `json.loads(json.dumps(entries, allow_nan=False))`. Record:
  `json.loads(json.dumps(verifier.jsonable(record), allow_nan=False, sort_keys=True))`

## Frozen inputs and their live replacements

| Input | Path | In git | Used by | Live replacement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| View packs (source records) | `frozen_views/packs/{gx_extension,marking_refit,broadcast_extension}_inputs.json.gz` | Yes | `prepare_view`. `experiments/annotator/independent_court/case_provenance.py` pins each pack's MD5 and the provenance file's, so any other pack fails loudly | A source record built from the video: DeepLSD fragments, person boxes, feet, frame size |
| Case provenance | `frozen_views/case_provenance.json.gz` | Yes | `prepare_view`, for views outside the control pack. Says which frames the image and person boxes come from. Person boxes mask the photometry only when they come from the image's own single frame | `court_detector/inputs.same_frame_provenance(view, frame)`, when the boxes come from the analysed frame |
| Frames | `frozen_views/frames/{gx,original,amateur}/` | Yes | Prepare view, pool evidence, W5 and the stripe refit | The decoded frame |
| Control views | `wider_evaluation/runs/20260922/control_inputs.json.gz`; frames in `evidence/independent_proposals/development/inputs/controls/frames/` | Pack yes; frames **no** (git-ignored, copy by hand) | The control swap | As for view packs |
| Standing-only feet | The `--feet` file, `feet_standing.json.gz` (138 KB) | **No**. Use the baseline's copy on Carmack: `fresh_feet_20260924/feet_standing.json.gz` in the court-detector run root. Rebuilding it needs the videos and the pose model | The feet swap | `court_detector/feet.py`, from the window detections. See "Feet" below |
| Window detections | Carmack: `fresh_feet_20260924/people/<view>.json.gz`, one per view | **No** | Building the feet file; `court_detector/run_views.py` | People and pose detection on the live video |
| Direction settings | `frozen_views/baseline_directions/gxBQ_window_00_frame_0.json.gz` | Yes | Search | Constants |
| Manifest | `wider_evaluation/runs/20260922/manifest.json.gz` | Yes | Refit's frame check | None. `run_views.py` keeps the check on the 28 test views |
| Saved control candidates | `automatic_axes_20260914/all_camera/` | **No**, and not in this checkout | W5's known-control diagnostic, on 3 views | None. The joined detector drops the diagnostic |

**Feet.** The baseline's feet come from the throwaway scripts in
`court_detector_optimisation_handover/claude_evidence/fresh_feet/`
(`extract_window_people.py`, `shot_check.py`, `build_feet_variants.py`):

- Detect people and poses in a 3 s window at 10 fps around the frame
- Keep only samples in the same shot as the frame
- Take each person box's bottom centre as a foot
- Drop seated people with `is_sitting` from
  `src/bst_x/preparing_data/heuristics/base.py`, threshold −0.3

Follow-up item 10 in the archived speed-up list
(`archive/20260925_optimisation_handover/CLAUDE_FOLLOWUPS.md`) covers this
choice.

`extract_window_people.py` saved the first step's detections as one record
per view (the "Window detections" row above). Each record holds the video
path, `fps`, `frame_count` (as decoded), `video_size`, the `anchor` frame and
`samples`: one per window frame, with `frame_index`, `bboxes`, `scores`,
`keypoints` and `keypoint_scores` in video pixels. `shot_check.py` decides the
shot from 64×36 grey thumbnails of the decoded frames.
`build_feet_variants.py` does the rest.

The joined detector does the last three steps itself, in
`court_detector/feet.py`, and takes the detections through the
`PeopleSource` interface in `court_detector/inputs.py`. It copies
`is_sitting` rather than importing it, because importing BST-X loads pandas
and its pipeline config. `tests/test_court_detector_feet.py` checks each step
against the evidence scripts and the copy against the original.

## What a single detector keeps and drops

**Keep**, as it changes the chosen court:

- The search on G0 and G1, with the budget-16 direction screen
- Seeded line templates, with the (4, 3) visibility floor
- W5's merge, measurement, refit and C ranking
- The net choice at weight 0.04 and overrun 4 px
- The stripe refit, after the choice, including `fixed_stripe_refit.prepare`
  on the chosen court's parent
- Every behaviour swap above, as a plain function argument or call

**Drop**, as it is research only:

- The search's input audit file (`inputs/<case>.json.gz`)
- Writing the population records and reading them back
- In `process_case`: the reference-field check, the B ranking, the
  permutation check, the known controls, the candidate reviews and the rank
  sensitivity
- Writing the case record and arrays, and reading the record back twice
- In the refit: the manifest and MD5 check, and the replay of the saved W5
  fit with its tolerance check
- The weight-0 check and the timers

The archived speed-up list
(`archive/20260925_optimisation_handover/CLAUDE_FOLLOWUPS.md`) estimates the
research files at about 580 s over the 28 views (6.5%). Legacy pool evidence
(its item 7) can go too: the joined
detector drops it with `legacy_evidence=False` and keeps the gate evidence
from the same `evaluate_pool` call. `court_detector/STRIPPED.md` lists each
dropped piece and where it would plug back in.

**Repeated work.** The joined detector does each of these once per view, or
once per process for the runtime:

- `prepare_view` runs three times per view: in the script, in
  `process_case`, and in the refit. Commit 7c74b015 already caches its
  `prepare_observations` step
- The frame is read from disk by each `prepare_view`, and again by the G1
  paint mask, each `evaluate_pool` call and the refit's colour sampling
- The runtime loads three times: twice in `run_cases.load_runtime`, once in
  `process_case`

## Decisions the code left open

`run_d17.py` leaves these open. The joined detector settles the first three
as decided on 25 September 2026.

- **The final court when the refit fails.** The script saves both the chosen
  court and the refit result, with no rule for which is the answer. On the 28
  views, 21 end with a valid corrected court. One,
  `sset_21_gloiZ_gTJaE_frame_00014336`, ends with an invalid corrected fit
  (`rank_deficient`). The script also catches refit errors; none occurred in
  this run. The joined detector returns no court, with the refit's
  `validity_reason`
- **Abstention.** Six of the 28 views have no gated court, all `sset_21_…`
  control views. The joined detector returns no court, with reason
  `no_gated_court`
- **Where the unit lives.** `court_detector/` for now. Moving it into `src/`
  or `experiments/` is still open
- **Which frames feed the feet** for a new video. The joined detector takes
  the scene's frame range in `ViewInputs.scene_frames` and keeps only window
  samples in the analysed frame's shot. The test harness passes the whole
  video as the scene. A scene cutter (PySceneDetect is the candidate) would
  supply real ranges

## How to check an integrated detector

Run the new detector and `run_d17.py` on the same 28 views with the same feet
file. For each view, compare `selection.bounded` and
`selection.polarity_refit.corrected` from the script's summary with the new
detector's output, bit for bit.

`court_detector/run_views.py` does this for the joined detector. With
`--baseline` (the baseline's `budget16` folder), `--feet` and `--artefacts`,
it checks each view against the baseline run: the chosen court, the whole
refit record, the feet, the shot check's grey differences, the G0 and G1 entries
(without the legacy evidence), the line templates' count and metadata, the W5
parents, children, fit attempts and C ranking, and the identity resolution.
Values must match in type as well: `1` and `1.0` count as different. Its module docstring gives the command.

Checked on Carmack on 25 September 2026. The scripts, logs and results are in
`court_detector/check_20260925/`:

- All 28 views equal the baseline on every check, including views run
  second or later in one process
- A `run_d17.py` rerun equals the baseline in every saved file, apart from
  durations, peak memory and paths that name the output folder
- The joined detector took 6,737 s over the 28 views with self-checks on and
  6,434 s with them off. The rerun's stages took 7,288 s under the same load
  (8 processes). Search and W5 compute take almost all the time, so joining
  the stages saves about 8-12%. Run-to-run noise is of the same size.

The baseline run lives on Carmack, in the court-detector run root:

- **Summaries**: `d17_camera_20260924/standing/budget16/d17/`, one
  `.json.gz` per view, 28 in all
- **Feet**: `fresh_feet_20260924/feet_standing.json.gz`. Pass the folder
  `fresh_feet_20260924` as the launcher's `FEET_DIR`
- **Launcher**: `court_detector_optimisation_handover/claude_evidence/fresh_feet/run_feet_variants.sh CHECKOUT OUT FEET_DIR PYTHON JOBS standing`.
  It writes each view's summary to `OUT/standing/budget16/d17/`
- **Window detections**: `fresh_feet_20260924/people/`, for `run_views.py`'s
  `--people`
- **Git-ignored inputs**: nine views need the control frames, and three need
  `automatic_axes_20260914/` unless the known-control diagnostic is
  dropped (the joined detector drops it). The baseline's checkout,
  `d17_camera_checkout_20260924`, has both under its `scratch/court_det_fix/`.
